1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,560
the hey there everybody how are you

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,190
i hope you're doing well so my

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,880
name is boris and today we're going

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,550
to go over how we can have

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,100
our own madama incense i'm sure

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,380
we have heard a lot of positive

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,180
things about it during my summer camp

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,120
and so i want to host a

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,900
workshop on how everyone kinds sold their

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,320
own motto making sense now when we

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,080
want to have a moto mod incense

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,300
up and running the first thing we

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,320
will need will be

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,350
b to have a computer to run

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,560
it

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,280
so we'll also go over where you

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,730
can find different providers and i'll try

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,890
to make it as easy to follow

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,460
but in case anybody has questions during

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,160
the workshop please feel free to write

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,930
in the chat and i'll do my

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,800
best to explain everything to so but

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,670
before we dive into madama first i

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,580
would like to introduce myself so as

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,980
a mention my name is boris i

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,910
am based in albania which is located

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,660
in europe and i have been contributing

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,900
to different open source projects for around

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,310
six years now

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,370
i am a member of the local

31
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,200
hackerspace often up cyberspace and i also

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,930
am part of cloud succeed doubts he'll

33
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,500
wear what we do is we maintain

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,770
of different open source instances like matomo

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,500
for example where we not only install

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,040
them but

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,860
we make sure that our backups monitoring

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,930
for the health of the service and

39
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,890
provide support

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,330
so i think that's a pretty good

41
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,990
beginning introduction about myself so without further

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,810
ado i would like to getting to

43
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,390
how you can have your own muttering

44
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,320
sense so for the guide i have

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,800
estimated that armento my incense shall be

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,160
able

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,860
two handler around the hon one hundred

48
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,340
thousand visits and that is based off

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,428
the official documentation from them but on

50
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,860
my website of course as you scale

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,380
up you might need a different set

52
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,540
up to accommodate for all the traffic

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,480
that are going to be having so

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,320
as i was meant

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,780
running first thing we're gonna need is

56
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,690
a computer or more specifically what we

57
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,540
need is a server that way when

58
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,730
somebody goes to the u r l

59
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,310
for our mcdonald's site they will be

60
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,890
able to see the website and there

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,020
are a couple of different providers one

62
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,310
of the first things you need to

63
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,060
keep in mind

64
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,940
is if you're doing a set up

65
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,520
similar to what we're going to do

66
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,550
we need to be aware of where

67
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,010
most of your user visits are going

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,620
to beef from because the closer the

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,530
server is to your users the faster

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,570
it will load if i am in

71
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,640
europe and i try to access a

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,370
a server for example in asia it

73
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,380
might be much slower to load compared

74
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,180
to a server that's in german

75
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,230
so one of the providers i highly

76
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,630
recommend usually had snare they offer dedicated

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,140
servers but they also offer reassure private

78
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,220
servers and the differences that explain very

79
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,881
briefly is that with a vps or

80
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:42,390
a virtual

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,750
private server essentially get a small chunk

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,788
of a physical machine and you can

83
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:50,760
install whatever you want on it it

84
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,550
has it's own operating system and it's

85
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,890
quite easy to add more hardware to

86
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,620
it whereas compared with a dedicated server

87
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,230
you have a lot more hardware and

88
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,640
computing power allocated

89
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,250
to it but it does require more

90
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,110
maintenance because you have to look out

91
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,080
for stuff like a hard drive failures

92
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,630
or ram corruption and you have to

93
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,130
constantly monitored

94
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,079
so in head snare the virtual private

95
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,690
server section they call it had snared

96
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,590
cloud and they have free good beginning

97
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,170
prices so for a in the sense

98
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,230
of about one hundred thousand users something

99
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,590
like the cx eleven tier which has

100
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,520
one cp

101
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,070
new core and two gigabytes of ram

102
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,950
is a good start and if you

103
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,000
essentially use all of that computing power

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,950
you can just upgrade to the next

105
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,290
plan and downgrade later on down the

106
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:49,590
line

107
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,720
another popular provider is digital ocean the

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,850
good thing about digital ocean is that

109
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,280
it has a lot more data centers

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,130
compared to a head sooner so petzner

111
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
only has data centers in europe and

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,150
yesterday or the day before that they

113
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,800
launched a new dataset

114
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,800
tour in the us but digital ocean

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,740
has data centers in a couple of

116
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,100
us cities in europe as well as

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,860
in asia so if you're outside of

118
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,560
europe i would highly recommend checking out

119
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,610
digital ocean another popular provider is also

120
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,960
the node which is free

121
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,470
fairly similar to digital ocean you can

122
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,530
of course use amazon web services and

123
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,710
google cloud platform i personally don't use

124
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,510
them because i don't agree with essentially

125
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,410
their ethics and google amazon and other

126
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,120
big tech companies have been known

127
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,360
to not be the most privacy respecting

128
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,270
companies out there so i tried to

129
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,460
stay away from them but of course

130
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,230
you are free to cost them wherever

131
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,650
you want

132
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,500
okay so in preparation for today's workshop

133
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,930
i have already created a server on

134
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,020
had snare and the domain for that

135
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,940
i am going to pace it in

136
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,910
the chat really quickly will be montana

137
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,090
test dot cloud succeed ducks yell if

138
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,800
you go to that to rl you

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,040
will

140
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,980
will not see anything load and that's

141
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,410
because nothing has been set up yet

142
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,110
so give me a bit of time

143
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,210
to share my screen and i think

144
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,710
you shall be able to see it

145
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,350
now let me just make it bigger

146
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,840
so that you can see if the

147
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,200
screen

148
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,390
size of the font size is too

149
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,820
small please let me know and i'll

150
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,510
increase it okay so first thing you're

151
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,280
going to want to do is to

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,560
connect to that server and for that

153
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,500
we use ssh so this is a

154
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,990
command that lets you connect to the

155
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,360
server as root which is

156
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,900
as a user that can perform and

157
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,270
execute all the commands on the server

158
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,090
which will be very helpful during installation

159
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,930
but it's usually recommended to not run

160
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,190
commands as root so now we are

161
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,140
inside the server and you can see

162
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,220
that because

163
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,430
here it says earth at mcdonalds test

164
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,790
whereas before it was saying boris at

165
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,820
whatever my computer name is

166
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,140
okay first thing you do after connecting

167
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,970
to a new server will be to

168
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,650
make sure that it's up to date

169
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,950
with the latest version because packages come

170
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,288
out all the time so new software

171
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,420
comes out all the time and since

172
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,450
this computer will be publicly accessed we

173
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,160
want to make sure it's up to

174
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,000
date so

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,420
so that it's more secure so this

176
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,690
is running ubuntu eighteen and to update

177
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,910
the packages we have to run two

178
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,430
commands the first one will be a

179
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,850
p t update and this essentially just

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,080
refreshes the list of new software but

181
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
it doesn't actually

182
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,560
the install them so if we let

183
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,570
it finish real quick there we go

184
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,580
it says that three packages can be

185
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,490
upgraded and to upgrade them what we

186
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,380
have to do is we will have

187
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,770
to run abt upgrade in this case

188
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,640
so let's just confirm that we indeed

189
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,809
want to update

190
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,830
okay there we go so now what

191
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,870
we have to do is we are

192
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,900
going to have to install some other

193
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,630
software's to make sure that you know

194
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,130
if you go to that you are

195
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,690
out that i shared in the chat

196
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,200
matomo shows up and your browser knows

197
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,520
how to interact with isp

198
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,880
computer so the different components that we

199
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
need installed are mainly a web server

200
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,730
where it is a programming sole on

201
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,160
the server so that your browser knows

202
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,770
how to talk to it we'll need

203
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,230
a database so this is where matomo

204
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,000
will store all the data that it

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
collects and four

206
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,860
this guide will be using something called

207
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,990
my sequel you of course you are

208
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,760
free to use whatever you want as

209
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,800
long as the programming is compatible with

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,290
it and the last thing we're going

211
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,330
to need to install will be the

212
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,380
ph be

213
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,630
software's into the server so montgomery's retiring

214
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,880
page p and for that reason we

215
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,980
need to make sure that the server

216
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,310
itself can around this program and then

217
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,320
serve that on your browser

218
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,670
okay so chain install the web server

219
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,610
it's really really easy using the abt

220
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,945
command from before we're going to tell

221
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,200
you to install and then we're going

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
to say the name of the program

223
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,250
that we want to install in the

224
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,410
case of the web server were going

225
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,960
to be using something called engine x

226
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:10,560
enough

227
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,730
very popular option is a patsy too

228
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,530
but there are a couple more you

229
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,351
might want to diving into at your

230
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,040
own leisure

231
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,040
and other than nc next we are

232
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,010
also being changed soul my sql server

233
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,590
so this is the web server and

234
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,710
this is the database server that's just

235
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,940
around that really quickly

236
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,600
now wind comes to peach pie insulation

237
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,260
you can use different versions of bhp

238
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,710
my domain itself recommends using page p

239
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:49,040
seven point two or up for this

240
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,440
guide we'll be using peach pies seven

241
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,240
point four so

242
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,640
so the problem then becomes that page

243
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,880
b seven point four is not available

244
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,110
by default icing in ubuntu eighteen point

245
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,690
of four so we have to add

246
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,570
something called a repository which is like

247
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,500
a list of other packages or other

248
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,400
programs that you

249
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,700
can install on your computer that are

250
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,660
not available by default so to do

251
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,640
that what we first have to run

252
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,510
is this command which install some it's

253
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,000
essentially the a p t command again

254
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,530
but it installed some background applications needed

255
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,390
to follow the other steps

256
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,360
and we can save this case because

257
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,210
it didn't say installing anything new it

258
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,260
was already present in my installation ok

259
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,500
now we are going to run another

260
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,070
command which is add abt repository so

261
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,190
essentially add a new list of possible

262
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,600
programs that you can install

263
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,290
lol and then the repository that we're

264
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:03,470
going to be installing is andre slash

265
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,320
bhp so if you press enter on

266
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,360
that it will warn us

267
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:11,360
the things that we need to keep

268
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,520
in mind off and then it'll ask

269
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,500
us to press enter to find a

270
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,360
team so we're going to do that

271
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,960
and here you can see that it's

272
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,530
updating the list of programs so these

273
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,780
are what it had by default and

274
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,120
then you can see here what we

275
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,080
just added

276
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,630
okay now we can run the steps

277
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,780
to install hp seven plane fall so

278
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,400
let's go ahead and do that

279
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,150
i am going to be installing a

280
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,680
version of the page piece of one

281
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,910
point or cold f pm so let's

282
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,350
press enter on that

283
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,550
and let's just give it a little

284
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,700
bit of time to configure everything

285
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,760
okay so now we are pretty much

286
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,137
almost ready to continue with a month

287
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:16,700
domain installation but bhp in ubuntu eighteen

288
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,190
comes with what are called modules so

289
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,602
these are optional software is that trains

290
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,000
so on

291
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,840
your computer and they provide more functions

292
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,110
to hp if you had over to

293
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,860
the matomo user installation guide so let

294
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,900
me get that ink and a setting

295
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,160
that chat really quickly

296
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,020
so in here you will see that

297
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,680
their recommendation is saying so a bunch

298
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,700
of packages i have written them down

299
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,820
beforehand and what we're going to do

300
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,160
is we're going to install them but

301
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,810
we want to make sure that we

302
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,520
installed the same version for them

303
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,460
the module as we did for ph

304
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,720
pi when we initially insulted here so

305
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,460
i said seven point four and i

306
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,650
have to make sure that in here

307
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,620
it also says seven point four so

308
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,570
let's go ahead and press enter on

309
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:14,840
that

310
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,280
the

311
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,050
and let's give it a bit of

312
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,660
time there we go now we are

313
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,143
ready to download the matomo code from

314
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,300
matomo website so let me re share

315
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:39,770
my screen really quickly

316
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,880
and i think it's

317
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,730
this fun yeah

318
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,410
okay so let's open that in and

319
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,920
blurry view while we're going try and

320
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,240
do is we're going to want to

321
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,580
go to the download montano section and

322
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,950
we can see that the latest release

323
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,040
is version four point five planes zero

324
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,860
and we're going to want to right

325
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,120
click this button

326
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,816
over here and we're going to want

327
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:11,900
to copy the link

328
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,940
now let's jump back into the server

329
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,190
so let me share my screen one

330
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,670
more time

331
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,430
okay and let's make it a bit

332
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,950
easier to read by removing all of

333
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,670
these things if you also want clear

334
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,280
screen in case you're following along you

335
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,280
can type clear and once press enter

336
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,000
it will

337
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,490
essentially free up your views so that

338
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,130
it's easier to read what's going on

339
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,860
okay first we're going to want to

340
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,360
download the u r l we just

341
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,300
copied so to do that in ubuntu

342
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,950
you can use curl or you can

343
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,430
use something called w got i personally

344
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,010
prefer wk so let's go with that

345
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,650
and the syntax for that will be

346
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,630
w got and the u r l

347
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,100
that we just copied

348
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,770
so once we press enter we can

349
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,590
see that it has downloaded it we

350
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,410
can verify this by running another command

351
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,890
called el asked which is something like

352
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,800
list structure we can see here that

353
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,090
montana doubts it does indeed exist in

354
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,280
my current directory so

355
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,110
you can see that it's a dog

356
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,110
zip file so it's an archive and

357
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,940
it has a bunch of folders inside

358
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,710
watch where you're going try and do

359
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,080
is we're going to want to unpack

360
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,350
that so first let's create a directory

361
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,310
called matomo

362
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,390
in two greater directory i use the

363
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,820
command called m k dear then a

364
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,770
space and then the name of the

365
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,440
directory i want to create then we're

366
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,200
going to type mv which moves a

367
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,020
file or a folder to another location

368
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,840
and we're going to move my tom

369
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,520
and outset to

370
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,109
the mob tama folder

371
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,500
though if you run out as one

372
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,300
more time we can see that now

373
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,780
we have this folder and inside that

374
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,089
folder we have a zip file that

375
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,960
we downloaded ok then we are going

376
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,540
to want to enter that folder and

377
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,160
all the comments that are going to

378
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,319
be executing now will take place from

379
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,500
they're so to change the directory you

380
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,510
have to use a command called cd

381
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,180
and then after the space has entered

382
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,220
the directory that you want to go

383
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,510
in saying that case cd optoma and

384
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,700
we are going to want to unzip

385
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,490
this so we say unsaid and then

386
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,420
the file name

387
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,730
moto amount of zip and we can

388
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,650
see it sprinting out a bunch of

389
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,500
stuff though if you run ls we

390
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,350
will see thursday how chainsaw mcdormand dot

391
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,350
html very similar to a folder and

392
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,480
then there's the moto m on top

393
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,550
zip file that we downloaded

394
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,360
now for the next tap water revenge

395
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,790
one i do is we are going

396
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,650
to want to move this moto mods

397
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,130
folder that we just extracted and we're

398
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,720
going to want to move that to

399
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,360
a place where our web server so

400
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,540
no place where the programming our computer

401
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,880
which make sure that the cycle

402
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,510
notes from the browser has the option

403
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,240
of reading those photos so to do

404
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,970
that let's use the mv command again

405
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,700
and say month to month and the

406
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,130
place where we want to move this

407
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,720
and you put is slash bar slash

408
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,040
www

409
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,130
so they says a the full directory

410
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,980
that is created when we install our

411
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,590
web server so if we go over

412
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,310
there now

413
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,760
we will see that we have html

414
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,630
and mcdonnell and if we go to

415
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,150
let me share my screen again

416
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,750
but essentially if we go to r

417
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,760
u r l so that is matamata

418
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,370
thought cloud six ltl we will see

419
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,830
a welcome change the next page which

420
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,170
to me doesn't look a lot like

421
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,750
the software were wandering soul but the

422
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,490
good thing is we can change that

423
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,360
so too

424
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,320
do let that let's jump back into

425
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,070
our terminal window where we are typing

426
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,850
the commands and first a free run

427
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,430
ls so the same command to show

428
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,710
the structure but this time we add

429
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,890
a dash al it will show us

430
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,490
a bit

431
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,690
more information on the contents of the

432
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:55,640
slash bar slash www folder and what

433
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,830
you're going to want to do is

434
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,110
that for them onto my user currently

435
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,960
its owner is the root user which

436
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,700
is the user i am logged in

437
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,663
as but it's generally

438
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,190
recommended that you change the permissions of

439
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,250
this folder so to change the permission

440
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,795
exactly to change the one area we

441
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:21,625
have to type eight to one and

442
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:24,415
then we're going to type a option

443
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:27,535
which says done changed the owner of

444
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:30,625
just this folder but changed the owner

445
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,745
of all folders and files inside this

446
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:35,035
folder so

447
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,995
that is dash our capital r and

448
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:41,725
then we defined the user that we

449
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:43,885
are going to grant ownership of this

450
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:46,315
folder to so in the case of

451
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,625
engine acts on you go to this

452
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,705
user is called w w w dashed

453
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:55,195
data and then we'd have to do

454
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:59,155
do the same thing but this time

455
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,345
what we are defining here is the

456
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:04,465
group so we essentially sat an owner

457
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,285
which is a user on our system

458
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:11,305
and a group that have ownership to

459
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,585
this folder so let's go ahead and

460
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:15,355
complete the command by specify

461
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:17,785
buying the directory that we want which

462
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:21,115
is matomo and press enter now for

463
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:23,245
the neck next step we're going to

464
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:25,945
want to change the configuration of our

465
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,765
web server so to do that we

466
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,205
are going to be using a text

467
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,115
editor i'm sure a lot of people

468
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:35,425
have strong opinions about which

469
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,095
text editor you should use in my

470
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:41,125
opinion you showed just use a text

471
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,375
editor that you know how to use

472
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:46,615
and can easily navigate around so in

473
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:49,375
my case i use nano and the

474
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,965
file we are going to want to

475
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:54,295
add it is located inside the geeky

476
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:55,255
se folder

477
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:58,015
which is where most of the configuration

478
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:01,975
for different softwares is located in phoenix

479
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:04,195
and we're going to say engine acts

480
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:06,595
and we can see that there are

481
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,335
a bunch of files and folders here

482
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:10,555
but the one we're interested in is

483
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:13,555
types enable so let's go ahead and

484
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:15,415
type that and

485
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,125
here we can see that there is

486
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,795
a file called the forward so let's

487
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:21,565
go ahead and since that

488
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,955
i will admit just for a minute

489
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,725
for the ambulance to drive by

490
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,385
okay no it must be a bit

491
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:51,865
easier to hear and so i have

492
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,665
i am going to cheat a little

493
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,915
bit i am going to be using

494
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,865
a nancy next template which i had

495
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:01,645
already prepared beforehand but you can find

496
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:05,635
pretty much the same configuration online

497
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:09,055
and i'm going to want to change

498
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:11,395
a couple of things so before i

499
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:13,915
change slammed let me first explain what

500
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:16,135
were you doing when you visit a

501
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:20,785
website and you go to http what

502
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:23,455
essentially you say is hey i want

503
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,035
to access this server but think of

504
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:26,395
the server

505
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,795
as a building share you might want

506
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,295
to enter a building but you have

507
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:32,215
to choose a door in which you

508
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:36,498
enter from and in computers we use

509
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:39,625
port to describe this behavior so you

510
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,695
want to specify a port for that

511
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:45,685
luckily for us or one luckily depends

512
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:46,555
in how we

513
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:50,725
look at it some ports are standards

514
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:54,925
so for http we use sport achy

515
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:58,675
and four https so that's why the

516
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:01,555
site has a green lock next to

517
00:24:01,555 --> 00:24:03,505
it and says that the site is

518
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:06,565
secure for your sport four four three

519
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:11,155
where not quite ready for four four

520
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:14,155
four three so let's change the configuration

521
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:17,905
of it by essentially commenting out some

522
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:20,935
of these functions but we can uncommon

523
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:23,545
them later to common then we just

524
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:26,875
use this icon in front of

525
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:29,995
what pre one to common so let's

526
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:33,655
go ahead and do that for a

527
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:36,295
few lines here what we're doing mostly

528
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:40,195
is where removing the ssl configuration so

529
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,625
we're removing the https config

530
00:24:43,735 --> 00:24:45,805
now this is not permanent because it's

531
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:49,585
highly recommended that you do run https

532
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,135
on your site because you don't only

533
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:55,945
protect your own systems but most importantly

534
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:59,695
you protect your users and then we're

535
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:02,935
going to want to change this option

536
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:03,655
right here

537
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,895
it's actually located in two different places

538
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:10,426
called inventory haas name and this is

539
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:14,425
a template for the automating tool that

540
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:17,395
we use at cloud sixty eight but

541
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:19,015
what we're going to want to type

542
00:25:19,075 --> 00:25:20,725
instead of that will be that you

543
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:23,995
are out for our website so long

544
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:26,695
the same atomic test thought clouds succeed

545
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:29,845
to seal and confirm everything

546
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:33,715
okay another thing we are going to

547
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:35,455
want to have to change is the

548
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:38,305
page b version because this template uses

549
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:41,665
version seven point two of bhp which

550
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,305
you can see here whereas read insult

551
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:47,365
beach before so let's make that change

552
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:51,085
as well and we are now

553
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:54,355
essentially ready to save the file so

554
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,785
in nano to save a file you

555
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:57,865
are going to

556
00:25:59,635 --> 00:25:59,965
ah

557
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:03,985
yeah i'd date commend the server section

558
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:07,075
so in nz next the way you

559
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:10,075
define teams is you define server blocks

560
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,225
and in there you enter configuration as

561
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,145
you can see here we have two

562
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:17,425
server blocks and the reason for that

563
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:20,155
is we have one that listens on

564
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:20,965
port eighty

565
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:24,295
and only does it just redirects you

566
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:27,445
to https and we have another one

567
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:32,005
for https now i haven't commented this

568
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:34,465
section here and that is so that

569
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:38,065
we are essentially just using a single

570
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:41,365
server running on port eighty which will

571
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:41,515
be

572
00:26:41,545 --> 00:26:43,525
serving them up to my website was

573
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,925
for going chunk common that later on

574
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,205
so let's

575
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,745
there we go so let's go ahead

576
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:55,585
and save by typing control and then

577
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:57,655
oh it will ask us where to

578
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:00,025
save lead to say that the default

579
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:02,455
file we opened and then we're going

580
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,095
to want to close the editor so

581
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:07,195
for that we type control and then

582
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:07,705
x

583
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:12,355
now we can go ahead and restart

584
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:15,503
our web server but it's usually recommended

585
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:17,515
we test if the syntax for what

586
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:20,905
pre-tested is correct so to do that

587
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,795
we are going to type and tenax

588
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:26,815
and then space dashti the cells and

589
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:28,495
tenax hey can you test my current

590
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:29,035
configure

591
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:31,645
ration and make sure i haven't forgotten

592
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:35,635
semicolon somewhere or forgotten to close a

593
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:36,535
server block

594
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:40,105
so we can see that the configuration

595
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:44,365
file is syntax is ok and we

596
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:47,485
are now ready to restart our program

597
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:51,895
to do this in ubuntu ubuntu uses

598
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:55,105
a system called system d so to

599
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,775
restart our web server are

600
00:27:57,895 --> 00:28:01,165
application with without restarting our entire server

601
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:03,925
which is a bit ineffective we have

602
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:08,065
to type system fifty out then the

603
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:10,375
operation that we want to perform claim

604
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,405
this case restart and then the name

605
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,115
of the program you want to restart

606
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:17,995
so there we go and if

607
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:21,715
free refresh our site now let me

608
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:23,185
just change my screen

609
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:32,605
we now see a new page which

610
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:35,275
is the motto my installation wizard and

611
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,525
the spades in my opinion is really

612
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:40,105
really cool because first thing it does

613
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,465
is it performs a system check and

614
00:28:43,495 --> 00:28:44,395
it sees a

615
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,855
if what you have is all correct

616
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,445
and if there is anything you need

617
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:50,425
to change so we can see the

618
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:52,855
hp emerging is find all of these

619
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:56,455
extensions and configurations are fine and then

620
00:28:56,455 --> 00:29:00,295
there are some optional such suggestions so

621
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:02,708
you can see force ssl connection when

622
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,165
we're not using ssl

623
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:07,075
and that's a problem it also gives

624
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:10,735
us a bunch of information now i

625
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,511
do want to continue to the next

626
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:15,355
step which is database setup but when

627
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:17,455
we go to database setup we can

628
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,865
see that we are going to have

629
00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:21,978
to enter a username a password a

630
00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:24,355
name for a database so it's probably

631
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:24,715
good

632
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:28,435
how to configure https before we move

633
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:28,675
on

634
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,895
okay now to configure https you usually

635
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:36,835
have to have a as something called

636
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:41,005
an ssl certificate and ssl certificates there

637
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,235
are a couple of different ways to

638
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:44,215
get them you can buy one which

639
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,165
lasts for a year or you can

640
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:48,415
use let's encrypt let me me it

641
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:49,255
really quickly

642
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:51,475
as for the ambulance to go by

643
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,635
so as i was saying you can

644
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,915
also use something called let's encrypt which

645
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:07,675
gives you a free certificate available for

646
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,865
ninety days so we're going to say

647
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:13,045
that our website is running and xanax

648
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:17,605
and we're going to use ubuntu eighteen

649
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:17,755
http

650
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,580
four it will show us some commands

651
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,950
that we can run those commands first

652
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,410
we have to install something called snap

653
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,440
t which allows us to install other

654
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,440
packets not available by bbt

655
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,900
and let me just copy this amend

656
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,030
beforehand this command essentially refreshes the list

657
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,420
of available programs for snap doing so

658
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,330
it's very similar to abt update that

659
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,200
we performed

660
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,800
and then we've gone around snap install

661
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,290
third bolts so this is a program

662
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,150
developed by the electronic frontier foundation which

663
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,520
essentially makes it very very easy for

664
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,580
you to get a let's encrypt certificate

665
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,530
and authenticate yourself

666
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,540
self and then be able to use

667
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,060
it last thing we're gonna do is

668
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,600
run this command which i can't go

669
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,685
into details about what he does to

670
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:23,440
to due to time constrain but it

671
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,170
makes it possible for us around sirte

672
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,330
bought in our system and for you

673
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,690
to respond to us so let's cancel

674
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,050
this

675
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,130
to get the ssl certificate we're going

676
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,830
to round third bought cert only so

677
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,770
only give us have the certificate don't

678
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,050
do anything else sorry to some and

679
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,600
then dash dash and sonax which is

680
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,120
the web server we have installed are

681
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,250
going to want to type a email

682
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,170
address to get

683
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,770
security notices and renew william co for

684
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,200
now let's just use no reply at

685
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,910
cloud succeeded as ceo

686
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,990
do you need to agree to their

687
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,780
terms of service and if you want

688
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:09,610
you can sign up for their newsletter

689
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,520
after you do all that it will

690
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,470
ask you what names you will want

691
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,050
the certificate for so it has already

692
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,240
gotten month-to-month desk from an end to

693
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,480
next configuration so that just press enter

694
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,720
and sag bulk will do everything that's

695
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,970
needed for us we won't have to

696
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,970
date care off verifying who he

697
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,130
we are very fine that we have

698
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,960
access to this i mean we're yelling

699
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,080
so now he can head back to

700
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,280
art enter next configuration and uncommon everything

701
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,580
that had commented so in here we

702
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,720
define the location for certificate and these

703
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,100
are some other

704
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,300
configuration options just to increase general security

705
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,120
on the site so let's go ahead

706
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,450
and say we around to max dashti

707
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,050
again to verify everything is running correctly

708
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,040
and we restart our web server again

709
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,190
now if we go back to our

710
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,970
site let me close my screen sherry

711
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:18,160
so i can show you my browser

712
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,630
we can see that now this website

713
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,410
is running on https and we are

714
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,200
now ready to do our database configuration

715
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,440
though to your database configuration we are

716
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,110
going to have to talk to our

717
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,810
database server which is sold in the

718
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,310
same server we were using

719
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:44,890
let's go there and let me share

720
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,310
this

721
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,636
okay so we're going to want to

722
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,250
type my sql to talk to the

723
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,170
server and we can see that the

724
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,660
view has changed a bit first we're

725
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,440
going to stay create database matomo you

726
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,960
can name this anything you want then

727
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,540
we're dying to say create user map

728
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,470
the only user

729
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,219
local falls so great that user in

730
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:09,940
this system

731
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,159
identified by i might be confusing it

732
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,130
a bit with another syntax for another

733
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,710
database server but let's use a really

734
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,850
really bad password for now and next

735
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,060
we're going to run grant all privileges

736
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,210
on matomo so grand

737
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,070
all accesses isn't much i want the

738
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,500
database to the user

739
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,020
okay so everything's done now we can

740
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,030
now close that and go back to

741
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,980
the web page we were reviewing before

742
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,770
and for logging we're going to say

743
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,670
matomo

744
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,719
user for the password the password to

745
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,840
be defined and the database name and

746
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,640
we're going to click on next

747
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,550
there we go so my domo has

748
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,040
successfully talked to the database and created

749
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,500
the structure needed for us to continue

750
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,380
now we create a super user so

751
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,970
this is our username for the administrative

752
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,850
account let me generate a

753
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,400
a quick password for this

754
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,451
there we go and we're going to

755
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:31,420
want to type our email address

756
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,020
and we can click on the configurations

757
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,020
options that we want and click next

758
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,390
and we can see that database access

759
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,060
denied so what i'm assuming is happening

760
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,730
here is somebody might have done this

761
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,600
configuration before we have so let's go

762
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,850
ahead and check the logs really quickly

763
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,700
and to give me a little bit

764
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,818
but oh i can see that my

765
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,900
screenshot is not working let me check

766
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,550
really quickly what's going on

767
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,780
lucky me just a second

768
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:55,600
okay

769
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,670
so i just read the configuration again

770
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,150
apologies for announcing but i was essentially

771
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,460
just going over to the website again

772
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,650
and now we can set up a

773
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,480
website that we want to monitor so

774
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,600
let's say cloud succeed dots field which

775
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,820
is located at the crl

776
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,370
we select a time zone for our

777
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,600
website so let's try to find tirana

778
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,530
or

779
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,620
begun to say you dc plus one

780
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:31,750
we click on next

781
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,470
and it will now give us the

782
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,810
madama javascript code which we can add

783
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,020
to our website and start having analytics

784
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,570
and that a spray much it we

785
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,200
now have a beginning insulation of matomo

786
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,300
there are a couple of things we

787
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,940
can further do we can add a

788
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,050
geo data

789
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,660
base that will show us you know

790
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,750
we can see that there is a

791
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,600
database upgrade required so to do that

792
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,230
let's copy this command and run that

793
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,700
on our server

794
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,140
and i can see that you're not

795
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,230
seeing my terminals let's change that

796
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:22,510
there you go

797
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,590
now it's generally a bad idea to

798
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,110
do this without backups but this is

799
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,810
a testing sense so i guess you

800
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,330
only live once in this case but

801
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,030
please don't just execute commands on a

802
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,330
production system without making sure you have

803
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,230
good backups

804
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,160
and that's the permission

805
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,680
and that's upgrade my tama

806
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,950
that may change my screen again

807
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,940
and everything i mean

808
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,060
let me take my password again

809
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,060
and there you go you now have

810
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,490
a month domain since running as i

811
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,500
was saying there are more things to

812
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,380
configure your incense you have to set

813
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,900
up automatic backups gap just set up

814
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:30,940
monitoring to make sure the incense is

815
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,070
healthy you do have to set up

816
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,370
something

817
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,200
called cron cron jobs retard essentially background

818
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,070
jobs that

819
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,090
perform different operations on the data and

820
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,570
make sure that your instance loads quicker

821
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,120
because it doesn't have to compute everything

822
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,460
at the same time it can just

823
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,530
show you the data it has processed

824
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,630
ahead of time i want to show

825
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,890
you a few configurations really quickly that

826
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,250
are

827
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:00,370
r

828
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,240
just to optimize things since if we

829
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,910
have time if not please feel free

830
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,790
to stop me but essentially we can

831
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,700
see here that it it says we

832
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,460
shall set forth ssl to one in

833
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,460
the general section of our configuration of

834
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,427
matomo and we need to increase the

835
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,610
map

836
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:25,575
packet eating our sql database to at

837
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:28,395
least sixty four megabytes though there are

838
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:31,365
different in configuration and tweaks that you

839
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:33,945
can do to your incense to make

840
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:38,925
it behave more responsive so in case

841
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:41,955
there are any questions please feel free

842
00:40:41,955 --> 00:40:42,285
to let

843
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:46,005
me now now's the time and i'll

844
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,285
look forward to answering them

845
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:04,995
though melanie asks how often showed the

846
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,385
archive cronjob a beast scheduled for every

847
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:12,405
hour or something else it really depends

848
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:15,795
in how much data you have really

849
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:19,725
i usually i set a config

850
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:22,875
duration where it rounds once every day

851
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:26,325
but this is for insulations that track

852
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:30,855
one hundred visits a day max you

853
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,045
can set this to run more often

854
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,845
something like an hour might be a

855
00:41:34,905 --> 00:41:38,085
good idea if the traffic are getting

856
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,885
is around one hundred thousand vis

857
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:40,455
visits

858
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:44,235
because that's essentially going to process all

859
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,115
the data and when matomo has to

860
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:49,515
calculate all of that when you load

861
00:41:49,515 --> 00:41:52,725
the page it's quite intensive for it

862
00:41:58,755 --> 00:41:59,295
no problem

863
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:26,325
marianne sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name

864
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:29,325
asks any reason for using nc max

865
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:34,875
to be honest there's no strong reason

866
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:37,215
why you should use and xanax or

867
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:40,305
apache two in my opinion they are

868
00:42:40,365 --> 00:42:43,215
optimized for different loads yes but the

869
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:44,925
main criteria you have to keep in

870
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:46,785
mind is you have to use a

871
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:49,095
software that are comfortable for

872
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:52,485
in my case i really like and

873
00:42:52,485 --> 00:42:54,915
syntax syntax it's really easy for me

874
00:42:54,945 --> 00:42:57,015
to read so that's what i use

875
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,715
but you can use any web server

876
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:01,845
there is on the planet as long

877
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,795
as you can configure a trap

878
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,455
and it seems like my pronunciation was

879
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:08,955
correct so eight

880
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:13,605
and lucas is sharing in the chat

881
00:43:14,145 --> 00:43:15,615
if you are using nt max you

882
00:43:15,615 --> 00:43:18,435
might want to look into this link

883
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:21,645
which is a github repository let me

884
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:23,625
open that between shares of the week

885
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,095
and take a look at it together

886
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:36,195
there we go

887
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:39,825
logan thank you for sharing this i

888
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:44,175
did not share it beforehand so we

889
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:47,925
can see that the matomo organization on

890
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:51,495
gate hub has a nc next configuration

891
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,775
from a demo so i would highly

892
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:57,405
recommend checking this out to have ascent

893
00:43:57,405 --> 00:43:59,595
surely the same configuration that i copied

894
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,265
over from our template you can find

895
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,505
that one in here and this is

896
00:44:05,505 --> 00:44:08,235
frequently updated so you might want to

897
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:10,905
check into it bland there are new

898
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:12,975
versions of the moto mom coming up

899
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:29,055
awesome

900
00:44:42,435 --> 00:44:44,775
okay so lucas is sharing that the

901
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:47,445
reasoning is that the ht access file

902
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:51,375
so these are some files that configure

903
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,505
a part of how the web server

904
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,935
operates and they're usually used when you

905
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,775
use apache to ucas points out that

906
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:00,525
these f

907
00:45:00,525 --> 00:45:02,917
files won't work in nc next which

908
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:05,505
is correct because it's an apache two

909
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:10,095
only setup so those configurations won't work

910
00:45:10,305 --> 00:45:13,125
and and tenax and they have had

911
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:17,685
to write the config rules manually and

912
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,595
it's very very important for you to

913
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:24,465
copy the correct config because otherwise ceremony

914
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:27,525
to sense might not be protected some

915
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,325
files in them up domain since may

916
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:32,445
not be protected and that's not a

917
00:45:32,445 --> 00:45:35,235
very good idea if you're muslim insulation

918
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:35,955
is public

919
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:45,885
so if i share my screen again

920
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:50,115
one such configuration for example is this

921
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:53,745
one and it says disable access to

922
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:57,562
the following directories config campy core and

923
00:45:57,612 --> 00:46:00,885
link and it says deny all requests

924
00:46:00,945 --> 00:46:02,205
to this location

925
00:46:02,205 --> 00:46:04,575
ems and show up for three error

926
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:09,165
code yup i think you should really

927
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:12,495
use this config because if somebody can

928
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:18,315
access your configuration folder remotely then it's

929
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:21,855
pretty much game over so you want

930
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:22,305
to protect

931
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:22,575
that

932
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:34,275
is there any other question that you

933
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:37,185
want answered of course you can ask

934
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:39,315
