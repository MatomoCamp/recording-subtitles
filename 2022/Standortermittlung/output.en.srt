1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A wonderful afternoon again from the Matomo Camp Conference.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It is a great pleasure for me now to introduce our next speaker, Udo Trautmann.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Udo Trautmann is a freelance IT consultant and takes care of customers when introducing portal content management systems,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
mainly on the topic of Web Analytics with Matomo.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In this context, we will also talk today about the geolocation of visitors from websites.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The lecture is about the various possibilities and data sources for the location investigation of website visitors

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and compares the resolution quality of the databases.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Without further ado, I hand over the floor to Udo Trautmann.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you very much for the introduction. Then I can briefly summarize myself at this point.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
At the beginning, he also sent a message to me.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Most of it has already been said that I have been filming in the Internet industry for over 20 years,

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
then I have been self-employed for 9 years.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I also blog about Matomo on my website and also send newsletters to my subscribers about Matomo topics.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So that I, I would say, have gained some knowledge about Matomo through blogging

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and not only about customers.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes, what do we want to look at in concrete terms today?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
First of all, I will go back to the various approaches of location investigation in Matomo.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What is behind it? How do you have to use the whole thing?

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then I will go into the subject of consent in the location investigation

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and also see if the anonymization of the IP addresses can be an alternative.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will go into the possibilities of the resettlement of the consent, i.e. the user consent,

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
in the location investigation.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then we take a look at tests and the quality of various geolocation providers

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and highlight the difficulties and challenges that these providers have

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
to return location data and name solutions that providers choose there.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And at the very end we look at an individual solution in the Tag Manager,

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
which saves the location with user-defined dimensions.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is meant by location investigation in the first place?

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The definition is relatively broad.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is the investigation of the location of a visitor based on IP addresses,

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
GPS coordinates, mobile phone cell data, WLAN information or voluntary data

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
that users have left at any time on the website or in an app.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For example, voluntary data could be that users indicate their location in a contact form

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
or that they are asked where they are when using a map.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
These are all additional topics for which a user has to be proactively ready to give this information a price.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We are already looking at what I have marked green here on the topic of location investigation with the IP address.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The IP address is the only thing that the user always gives a price for,

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
because it is technically sent from the browser to the Matomo server,

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and of course also to the website's web server.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
First of all, as I said, let's take a look at what Matomo offers out of the box for location investigation.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We have a screenshot from the Matomo backend provider selection in the agent menu under system location recognition,

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
where you can make various settings that, as I experience in practice,

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
are technically more complicated for most customers,

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
so that they actually leave their fingers behind and maybe choose what is offered with standard.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I have tried to summarize these different providers as compactly as possible in a table

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to explain what these different settings actually mean.

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
On the one hand, of course, you can deactivate them first,

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
so that no information about the location and the country of the visitor is saved in the visitor profile at all.

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The standard setting is an investigation of the location based on the browser language,

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
so not based on the IP address.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The pauses have been installed in addition to the language of the user interface.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
For example, for Austria, DE-AT is sent for Germany, only DE,

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
or for the English language of the Americans, EN-US,

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and with this mechanism, the country of the standard provider Matomo is investigated at this point.

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But in this sense, this is actually not a standard investigation, not a geolocalization,

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
which I will probably use as a synonym here more often in my lecture.

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
More exciting, or rather already more in this direction,

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
with standard investigations based on the IP addresses,

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:11,000
there are two provider settings that hide their cryptic name DBIP slash GOIP2 for visitors.

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
These are providers that use databases from the providers DBIP

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
or from the company Maxmind with their GOIP2 database to track the IP address

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and then receive data from the database about the location,

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the region, the country and the continent of this IP address

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and then save them in the visitor profile of Matomo.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There are two options available for this database query.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
One with PHP and one with Apache Engine X, i.e. two web servers.

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The PHP variant works in such a way that within Matomo with PHP,

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
so Matomo is programmed in PHP, the database queries.

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The data or the IP address does not leave the Matomo server in this case,

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but the database is on the server on which Matomo is installed,

71
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
so that the query takes place locally.

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The variant with the web servers, with the web servers, i.e. Apache and Engine X,

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
takes place within the web server where Matomo is installed

74
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
by an extension that has to be installed and configured in the web server.

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This web server extension also works there with the local data bank

76
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and then transmits the information from the site to Matomo via the server variant.

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It is a rather technical process.

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I will go into more detail about when to actually use which of these providers in the field.

79
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's start with Apache Engine X.

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Here you definitely need someone outside the IT department,

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
someone who takes care of the web server.

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is in contrast to the settings with PHP or the standard settings,

83
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:35,000
which a Matomo administrator or a Matomo supervisor can take up on his own.

84
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
By the way, I also made a point here.

85
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
PHP and MaxMind GeoIP2 database are the settings for those who use the Matomo Cloud,

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
or the chosen provider, which, in my opinion, cannot be changed there either.

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Everything I do now, you still have to understand in context,

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
do I now have the Cloud solution in use?

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What does that mean for me if I use the GeoIP2 PHP provider

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
or have I installed Matomo myself?

91
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Then, of course, I have all the flexibility to take this setting into account.

92
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
In terms of completeness, I would also like to mention a plugin,

93
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
which is available in the marketplace for free.

94
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The plugin works with another provider than the one previously mentioned.

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The provider IP2 Location is used here.

96
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The IP address is also asked in a database either within Matomo with PHP

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
or there is a web service access to the provider.

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A registration is also required to make the whole thing work.

99
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
When are these settings useful?

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When does which of these providers offer?

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
On the one hand, we have the standard provider,

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
where the language information of the browser is accessed.

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The situation that this can be useful

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
when the available IP addresses have been anonymized,

105
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
either with two or three bytes,

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and in this way can actually no longer be used in a meaningful location.

107
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Here it just makes sense that you say,

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
OK, then you just go back to the language information of the browser

109
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and find out what it is.

110
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There can also be constellations.

111
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It rarely happens, but I have 10% or maybe 5% of Matomo installation setups

112
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
have already seen that for technical reasons

113
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the actual IP address of the browser does not even arrive at the Matomo server.

114
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is usually the case when network infrastructures,

115
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
put simply, are so complex that through firewalls, load balancer, proxy, server,

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
which do not pass on the original IP address of the user,

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
but only somehow pass on their own to Matomo.

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We have a constellation here that Matomo does not have this IP address under circumstances.

119
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The db.ip2-geo.ip-provider with PHP is then useful

120
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if we have the entire IP address of the user,

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
or maybe only have one anonymized byte available,

122
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
or even if we do not normally track with Matomo,

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
not with JavaScript, but work with server log file import,

124
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
then you actually have to take this provider,

125
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
if you want to investigate locations at all,

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
because the other providers, in this case in the case of server log file import,

127
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
can't work at all.

128
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You also have to choose this provider,

129
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
by force, if you want to work with IP geolocation,

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
if you let the Matomo run in a shared host,

131
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
because usually you can't get to the Apache or Nginx

132
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
at the Apache or Nginx

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and can't make any configuration there.

134
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's why this PHP variant is the only useful one.

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In practice, this is very common in installations with WordPress,

136
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
where you can usually run your website at a very low cost

137
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
at shared host.

138
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And then you can finally only use this provider

139
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
for developing the IP standard.

140
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The provider for the web server with Apache and Nginx

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is also in this case only really useful

142
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
if you have the IP addresses completely or with one anonymized byte,

143
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
or if you have this more complex network-technically complex situation

144
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that the client IP addresses, i.e. the IP addresses of the visitors,

145
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
have to be investigated by the web server by means of web server directives,

146
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
where you can give yourself the remote IP address

147
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to be able to conduct the stand-alone investigation with that address.

148
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Or if the web server in which Matomo runs is already doing geolocation,

149
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
because, for example, he also checks the IP addresses on a website

150
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
based on some content delivery or content blocking measures on a large portal

151
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and decides which content he wants to play or is allowed to play.

152
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Of course, you can use the information provided there in the same way

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
to hand it over to Matomo and don't have to do it extra Matomo again.

154
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The provider can also be useful if you are able to conduct the whole application

155
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
individually for the stand-alone investigation.

156
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll go into that in a moment and show you an example

157
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
of how you could do that in Engine X.

158
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The provider, as I said earlier, is not just so easy to activate

159
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
by a Matomo administrator,

160
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
but you need a web server administrator who compiles the TRIP software,

161
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
installs it in the web server and then also provides the appropriate configuration.

162
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
As far as I know, it is only possible with the solution of NextMind

163
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
if in the chat in the expert format or otherwise.

164
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You can also correct me there.

165
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I haven't found a setup yet that has found something

166
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
where you can do that in the web server with the DBIP database.

167
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But maybe the software from NextMind also works with the DBIP database.

168
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't know, so I didn't find it documented.

169
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That might be an interesting feedback for me today in the round

170
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
whether that is possible at all.

171
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes, and then let's look again at the plugin from IP2 Location.

172
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll go a little further here.

173
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't give any recommendations for this plugin

174
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
or for the quality of the determined standard results,

175
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
because in a test that I did,

176
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will also show you the test results in detail,

177
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
it was actually only correct with, even with the full IP address,

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
the country, but again the state,

179
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in addition to the local data,

180
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
it was correct with the Geo Location provider,

181
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
so that I can't give any direct recommendations here at the moment.

182
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The topic is the obligation to vote and anonymization.

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Is anonymization an alternative to the obligation to vote

184
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
in the development of the location?

185
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I've already mentioned this in part,

186
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
but we have the legal situation in Germany

187
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
that a location investigation without the consent of the visitor

188
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
is not allowed to use the IP address.

189
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's not even about the storage of the IP address,

190
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
which is definitely not stored on the subject at Formatomo,

191
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
but it's about processing,

192
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
because you have to prevent that a personability can be produced.

193
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The whole thing was established long before the DSGVO,

194
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
there were decisions by the top authorities of the Data Protection Conference in Germany

195
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
in November 2009,

196
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I have posted two links here, if you can read them.

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
One spoke and said that a shortening of the IP address is possible,

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that is to say, anonymization of individual bytes,

199
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
which then allow processing without consent.

200
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In the former formulations,

201
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
it's not about how many bytes you have to shorten.

202
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Maybe that's another input that someone can give in the round.

203
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I have this to show you what it means

204
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in terms of the impact of the quality of the location

205
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
with anonymized IP addresses.

206
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I've done a few tests.

207
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The MaxMind company offers a tool,

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
a console tool that you can download,

209
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
which you can run to test the database of MaxMind,

210
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
with which you simply enter an IP address

211
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and then get the data back.

212
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's an easy tool to test for any IP.

213
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I have chosen random test IPs.

214
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Here is my example, the 188, 172, with two anonymized bytes.

215
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Matomo then replaces the x with 2.1

216
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and then makes the query for all users

217
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
with whom the IP addresses begin with the first two bytes.

218
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
As we can see, we have an IP address

219
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
where this range is incredibly large.

220
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And here, with this GeoIP2 database,

221
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
IP addresses are not only from other European countries,

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but are even from South America, North America and Asia.

223
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So in this respect, you have to come to the realization

224
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that if you take two-bytes anonymization here,

225
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
the result of the location investigation

226
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
does not necessarily correspond to the topic that is important.

227
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But there can be, I have to say openly,

228
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
IP ranges where the first two bytes

229
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
can be found in two or three countries,

230
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
maybe even only in one country.

231
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So I think, especially in the USA,

232
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
where so many IP addresses are assigned,

233
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it can certainly be that with an anonymization with two bytes,

234
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the hit is still only for the USA.

235
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes, with an anonymization with one byte,

236
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
it looks much better.

237
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
In my tests, it was like that,

238
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
especially with German IP addresses,

239
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that the state was actually always uniform

240
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and in most cases also the place.

241
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
In any case, say, in rural areas,

242
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
it could happen that smaller towns,

243
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
smaller cities within these 552 bytes were found.

244
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But at the end of the day, you have to say,

245
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
with an anonymization with one byte,

246
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
the results are still acceptable

247
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and can be described as good.

248
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes, what possibilities do you have at all

249
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
when the legislator prescribes here

250
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that you have to make a decision for the local investigation?

251
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
With the out-of-the-box possibilities of Matomo,

252
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
so for the things we have talked about today,

253
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
if we want to do a local investigation

254
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
with the full IP address,

255
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
we have, I'll put it this way,

256
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
we have it relatively difficult

257
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
because we have to even link the whole thing

258
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
to the consent for tracking

259
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
with the version with the PHP provider,

260
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
because Matomo does not support

261
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
individual consent in the local investigation,

262
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but the whole topic of consent management in Matomo

263
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
always refers to the question,

264
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
do I want to track a user at all, yes or no?

265
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And in this case, we have to, so to speak,

266
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
if we do this with the provider,

267
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
design the application banner,

268
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
the cookie or consent banner in such a way

269
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
that our visitors, if they agree to the tracking,

270
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
then they are also informed

271
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that they agree to the local investigation topic

272
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and if they reject it,

273
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
then they should not be tracked

274
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and then of course no location is investigated.

275
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
With the provider version with the web servers,

276
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
here we can act a little more flexibly,

277
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
here we can evaluate the cookie

278
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
that is available to us in the web server

279
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
to the consent

280
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and can only then

281
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
carry out the local investigation in the Matomo web server.

282
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If the user has rejected or the cookie is missing,

283
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
then we would

284
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
hand over any default value to Matomo as a location

285
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
that Matomo later says

286
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the user did not register here.

287
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yes, here you could actually design the content banner individually,

288
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
either for tracking or for the local investigation

289
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
or only for the local investigation,

290
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
if you have decided for tracking, for example,

291
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
not to register.

292
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This is always an example

293
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
for someone who also administers the web server.

294
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So you can here in the Nginx web server,

295
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
but in Pechigi this is also possible,

296
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you can

297
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
ask for the cookies and here in this case

298
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
the cookie named Claro,

299
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
so this is the framework of the consent cookie name,

300
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
if it is assigned to Matomo,

301
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
then I can get the various information

302
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
from the geo database

303
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
for the continent, for the country,

304
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
even the geo coordinates,

305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and then I can write them into these variables

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that start with mm

307
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and they will then be handed over to Matomo by Nginx

308
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and Matomo

309
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
then writes them into the visitor profile.

310
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes, and if the user has rejected this consent

311
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
or the cookie is not there at all,

312
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I just put the country,

313
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the information of the country, on unknown,

314
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I could have written in here, rejected or something,

315
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so some information that is then processed

316
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
in the visitor profile in Matomo

317
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and based on which I will later recognize,

318
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
okay, these are now visitor data,

319
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
or visitors who have not given

320
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
their consent.

321
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay, now let's go

322
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
very quickly, or let's make a very quick

323
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
side trip away from very specific Matomo

324
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
topics and look at various providers

325
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
on the subject of location research or

326
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
geolocation

327
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and look at why it is actually

328
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
so difficult for them,

329
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
in all cases, at least always good data,

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
reliable data to provide us

331
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and with which, I have now called them intelligent approaches,

332
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
with which approaches

333
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
these providers work to increase

334
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
the data quality and also the actuality.

335
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Because their problems are

336
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
actually, as I just said,

337
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the actuality on the one hand and on the other

338
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the accuracy, i.e. the exactness

339
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
of the determined location data.

340
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm going to go into that in a moment,

341
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I have a map of Germany in the background

342
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
with yellow dots.

343
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
These are not random points, but

344
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
these are actually test results

345
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
from tests that I have carried out

346
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
from my location here in Berlin

347
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and these are IP addresses that belonged to me.

348
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The larger the yellow circle, the more hits

349
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
it has given in the locations, so you can see

350
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
that it has already given most hits in Berlin,

351
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
but I was also spread across all of Germany

352
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
with the complete

353
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
full IP address.

354
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So a customer's image, so you can't

355
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
really talk about accuracy anymore.

356
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I would like to add right away

357
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that these points are the test results

358
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
of all possible providers

359
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and that the best providers

360
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
have delivered

361
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
much more concrete or rather much more

362
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
more precise results

363
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and have located me much more often

364
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
in Berlin.

365
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Before I show you the results, maybe

366
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
briefly describe the test scenario.

367
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I have seen 14 offers in a year.

368
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I tested the whole thing over three months

369
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
with then repeatedly changing IP addresses

370
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
from Berlin.

371
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Ten tests took place with DSL,

372
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
so with a DSL connection with Vodafone

373
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and ten tests with a mobile phone connection

374
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
with LTE.

375
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I have carried out the tests with the

376
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
freely accessible offers of the providers on the website

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
or with the databases that could be

378
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
sold in Matomo.

379
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The result of the following test results

380
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
are different providers.

381
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I have mentioned Max many times before.

382
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Here, nine out of ten times

383
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
can be located in Berlin

384
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
with a DSL connection.

385
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Four out of ten times

386
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
can be located in Berlin

387
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
with a mobile phone connection.

388
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I don't want to go through the points one by one.

389
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You can download the file.

390
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The link is also included in the presentation profile.

391
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You can see here that next to Max,

392
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
who offers both a commercial

393
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and a free database,

394
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
IPregistry.co and Big Data Cloud

395
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
have achieved results

396
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
that have been found in this quality area.

397
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
After that, we already have providers

398
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
who have brought results on average.

399
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Then we have a whole bunch of offers

400
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
down here that were only

401
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
in some cases correct

402
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
or partly not at all.

403
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Here I also have DBIP,

404
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
which has a commercial and a free database,

405
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and IP2 Location, which is also

406
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
marked in Matomo.

407
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That's why I mentioned earlier

408
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that I can't recommend using them here.

409
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What came out of it,

410
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
what you have to say about the so-called

411
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
test winners of MaxMind,

412
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
IPregistry and Big Data Cloud,

413
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
if their results were wrong,

414
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
then I wasn't located here in the surrounding area

415
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
of Berlin, but the results were really wrong.

416
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Then I wanted to go to Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg,

417
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Niedersachsen and so on,

418
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
in areas that were partly hundreds of kilometers away from Berlin

419
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and then were completely wrong again.

420
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
In some cases,

421
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
the providers were not yet able

422
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
to give back the locations in all cases.

423
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So if the results were wrong, then only

424
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
federal states were given back.

425
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Especially in Baden-Württemberg,

426
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I was often located.

427
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But you have to say that at MaxMind

428
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and Big Data Cloud,

429
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
which offer their customers quality announcements

430
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
on their website,

431
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that these quality announcements

432
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
have also been made at my tests.

433
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That means that at DSL, 80 to 90 percent of the hits

434
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
were in the tolerance circle of 50 kilometers.

435
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Correct. And with mobile phone devices

436
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
or mobile phone use,

437
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the accuracy of hits was about 50 percent.

438
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So that's also what the providers

439
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
promise, at least for Germany.

440
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You can check with both providers

441
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
what they do for other countries

442
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
for quality announcements.

443
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That can also vary, so that the results

444
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
are even better.

445
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The smaller the countries,

446
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
the worse.

447
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Why is that?

448
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
A brief overview. What difficulties do they have?

449
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
A big topic is the actuality of the data

450
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
with which they can work.

451
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Because the Internet Service Provider

452
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
of course puts the data where the IP address

453
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
is assigned to which customer,

454
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
never live to them.

455
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
In that sense, they do not access

456
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
all Internet Service Provider in the world live.

457
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
That is of course one topic. The other topic

458
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is that you generally,

459
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that is now more from the customer's point of view,

460
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
often have wrong expectations, because you

461
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
have the IP address and location data

462
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
related to the expectations. That would be the geo coordinates.

463
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But that is actually a wrong expectation.

464
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Then it may be with some

465
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
fixed-installed proxy servers, but for example

466
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
for smartphones, with which the people are on the move,

467
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
it can never be a geo coordinate

468
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
that is delivered to them as a request.

469
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Then there is the rotation of the IP addresses

470
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
that are dynamically assigned to the customers

471
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
on this topic.

472
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Most people have

473
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
IP addresses that are dynamically

474
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
assigned to them by the service providers.

475
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That can be a problem almost every day.

476
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Of course, this is also a difficulty with which the service providers

477
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
have to fight.

478
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Then, of course, users of mobile devices,

479
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
in a literal sense also mobile.

480
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That means that the IP addresses of mobile devices

481
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
are never at the same location.

482
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
For example, you have to get in line in advance

483
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and drive 100 kilometers, maybe even longer,

484
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and the IP address does not change at all.

485
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So that is also a topic where you have to understand

486
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
that with mobile devices the returned location

487
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
can't really be right so often.

488
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Finally, you still have

489
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
the whole topic of proxy servers in the company

490
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and the employee sits in the home office,

491
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
but surfs over the company's proxy server,

492
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
or people surf over VPN networks,

493
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
over anonymization services,

494
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
where the IP address is never actually,

495
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
or rather unconsciously, not at the current user location.

496
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The providers have different solutions

497
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
with which they try to get all this

498
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
problematic in the head.

499
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
They try to collect the OZ data

500
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that they have received from the service providers

501
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
with their own information,

502
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
which they collect additionally with their own mechanisms,

503
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
where they take back some of the algorithms

504
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
that they have implemented,

505
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
where they also take back feedback from their customers.

506
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This can be data that is

507
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
also available here.

508
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Or not all of them are available to all providers.

509
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
For example, there is something like a trust value,

510
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
i.e. how reliable can you estimate this OZ data at all,

511
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
whether low, medium or high.

512
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
There are circumference data

513
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
to the radius of the accuracy of the OZ data.

514
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
These are, for example, typical ranges

515
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that individual providers share with us.

516
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
MaxMind, for example, can provide such information

517
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
as well.

518
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I have to say that Motomo does not process it.

519
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Then we have information

520
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
whether it is about mobile phone network providers

521
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
with the IP address,

522
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
whether it is about VPN or the museum services,

523
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
cloud services, or whether the IP address

524
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
has already been used in the past for any

525
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
traffic issues.

526
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Most of the time you have to pay for such

527
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
additional data.

528
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So, apart from the MaxMind

529
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
database, where this is still available for free

530
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
for Germany at least,

531
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and only for the USA, I only have the other

532
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
information from cost-effective providers.

533
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yes, if you use them,

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
so to speak, if you close a contract with such

535
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
a provider, then you can

536
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of course decide for yourself whether to process

537
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
these criteria and whether you will then

538
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
process the location value at all.

539
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
If, for example, you find that it comes from

540
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
an anonymization service or a VPN,

541
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
then I ignore the location.

542
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And I would like to show you this

543
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
in an individual example shortly,

544
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
where the project with the tech manager

545
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
has been implemented.

546
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It was also about considering the

547
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
willingness of the visitors of the website,

548
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
the geolocation provider, who is then

549
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
approached via a web service interface

550
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and with whom we have evaluated the topic

551
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
whether it is about spam or cloud trading

552
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and then saved the location as a user-defined

553
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
location.

554
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That was with the provider ipregistry.co,

555
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
which I think is located in France and which

556
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
also supports the HESC-IVO.

557
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And here we have, we are here on the left,

558
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
two custom dimensions,

559
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
for the country and for the city.

560
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And here we see in the screenshot the saved

561
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
information from the city. In brackets we have

562
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
country information with saved.

563
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes, this is a look at the, and a very simple

564
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
look at the JSON structure that

565
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
ipregistry provides. I have the

566
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
local information here and I have a set

567
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
of security parameters down here

568
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that you can check. It is a spam

569
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
IP address, cloud IP, proxy, VPN and so on.

570
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And this information

571
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
we have partially, or I have partially

572
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
evaluated in the script

573
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
that has been executed in the Matomu Tech Manager

574
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
as a tag, which has been called

575
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
after the page view trigger.

576
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And we see here, just briefly,

577
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm just getting the country out of the JSON structure.

578
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The city, the spam information

579
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and the cloud information, and if it is not about

580
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
spam and cloud, the country and city

581
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
are then pushed into the data layer

582
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
from the tech manager and

583
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
processed there as a tech manager event,

584
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
as a data layer event.

585
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And then there is also tracking

586
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
towards Matomo, implemented manually.

587
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The tracking event

588
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
as dimensions,

589
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
the whole thing is therefore

590
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
tracked again with the event here and not

591
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
with the page view, because the standard investigation

592
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
takes place asynchronously and

593
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
can take longer than the page view

594
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
needs.

595
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Therefore, the whole thing, I say, is tracked a little bit here

596
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
not as an event, but as

597
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
a user-defined dimension.

598
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And last but not least, again a look at Big Data Cloud.

599
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Here we have in the JSON structure

600
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
this confidence parameter, which

601
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
indicates to us how trustworthy this

602
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
IP address is at all, or this standard address.

603
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And here on the right is

604
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the cell phone address, whether it is

605
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
a mobile phone network,

606
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
although you have to find out about algorithms.

607
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is not an information that the service providers

608
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
provide.

609
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And finally, I want to quickly summarize

610
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the two recommendations for you.

611
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
When using out of the box, of course, the recommendation

612
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
goes away from the standard settings, use

613
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
the MaxMind GOIP2 database, you have to register.

614
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
However, you can use the

615
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
free version.

616
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Then the whole thing is set up in such a way that

617
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
you update the GOIP2 database

618
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
weekly, because MaxMind

619
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
makes the database available again weekly.

620
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But do you always have in mind that

621
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
anonymization with two or more bytes does not bring any meaningful results?

622
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Do you have in mind that

623
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
80 to 90 percent of local results

624
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
are correct for 50 kilometers

625
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
in a circle, while mobile phone devices

626
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
are only at most half?

627
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It is difficult for me to give a really good,

628
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
qualitatively good recommendation on how to

629
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
filter out these mobile phone locations.

630
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
A rough approach could be

631
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
to build a segment in Matomo by

632
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
filtering out mobile mobile devices.

633
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Which of course does not mean that

634
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
mobile phone devices can of course also come over a WLAN,

635
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
would then have used a DSL connection again.

636
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Or vice versa, of course, someone can also be

637
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
on the road with a laptop and use a SIM card

638
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and would then still appear

639
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
here in the segment result.

640
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But it would be an approach to at least

641
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
provide a sample overview of the locations

642
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
of the visitors on my website.

643
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
If you want to be tracked

644
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
without tracking,

645
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you should be tracked

646
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
by a user without tracking.

647
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Oh, then you still need a

648
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
recommendation for the location investigation

649
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and you have to submit it in the consent banner

650
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and then it is only possible

651
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
via the version with the web server.

652
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Then I can simply recommend you

653
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
to make your own individual solutions with other providers

654
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
via a web service API.

655
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You can speak as a user-defined dimension,

656
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
as I have shown you.

657
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Of course, you can also write your own plugin,

658
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
but of course it is much more complex

659
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
to write a Matomo plugin. In this case, you could

660
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
deactivate the normal location investigation in Matomo

661
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and provide even more information

662
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
with your web services than the providers do in Matomo

663
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and can still select these additional criteria

664
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and save very detailed

665
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
or rather very precise data

666
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
in Matomo. You can only do this

667
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
if you really have the consent of your user.

668
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So, with that I am now

669
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
through the quick run.

670
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Now I will ask you

671
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
if you have any questions.

672
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So far, everything is clear.

673
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yes, thank you very much.

674
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There were actually two questions in the chat,

675
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
although one has already been answered

676
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
in the course of the lecture.

677
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
There was also a feedback on the legal

678
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
questions about anonymization,

679
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
that the anonymization should be sufficient

680
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
for one byte. However,

681
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
especially with a German competitor

682
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
from Matomo, it is also TÜV-certified

683
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
how it is done, because the DSGVO assumes

684
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
that a personal relationship of a group size

685
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
of 15 people is no longer possible.

686
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
However, it also states that it is not

687
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
legal advice, but not quite

688
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
a reasonable truth.

689
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It is also

690
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
completely clear to me.

691
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
At this point, I do not have the right

692
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
to make a legal advice on this topic.

693
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
For me, or for the situation

694
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
with Matomo, it is of course the case that

695
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
we, because of the anonymization

696
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
at the location of the development, if I want to

697
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
make a legal advice, then I have

698
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
of course also saved it in the visitor profile

699
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
with only one byte.

700
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Of course, we always have the Matomo

701
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
back-end in there, that the anonymization

702
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
in the visitor profile with two bytes

703
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
is recommended. Now I have to briefly

704
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
look at where the screenshot was.

705
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Well, anyway,

706
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
you can make the anonymization

707
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
with two bytes

708
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
in the visitor profile.

709
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And by doing so, of course, many data

710
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
protectors from the front say, I want to have

711
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
another anonymization with two bytes in the

712
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
visitor profile, then of course I can

713
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
do that in the location development.

714
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I also have the additional question

715
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
whether the country should not also be usable

716
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
legally without consent, i.e. without

717
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
consent. I think so, because

718
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
if you now read the formulation from

719
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
this recommendation or this program from 2009,

720
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
that back then

721
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
it was actually only about this

722
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
personability. I mean, if you

723
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
google it, there are also bloggers or

724
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
other platforms and agencies that of course

725
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
also write what to do if you have

726
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
your only customer e-commerce shop that

727
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
is located in North Africa

728
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and makes an order for you

729
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and that then even the country is still

730
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
sufficient to find out

731
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
what he actually has here from the

732
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Matomo visitor profile.

733
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
This is always something that I find

734
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
in practice with the data protection

735
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
tasks of the respective website or

736
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
individual customers.

737
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
My experience is that they are usually

738
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
very different and not all,

739
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
let's say, the legislation is also

740
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
the same in the petition.

741
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Question back to Joachim, recommendation is

742
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
with two already analysing

743
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
visitor profiles.

744
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yes, just as an explanation,

745
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
the stream is always 40 seconds delayed,

746
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
that means it probably takes a short time until the answer

747
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
comes from him to the question.

748
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
In the meantime, there was also the

749
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
question whether you do DSL with a

750
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
dynamic IP or a fixed IP.

751
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I only tested once a week

752
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
or sometimes after 14 days

753
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I also had a new IP address

754
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
checked every time.

755
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Joachim answered that.

756
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yes, okay.

757
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
If there are any other questions,

758
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
then it is best to ask now.

759
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Otherwise, the chat room will

760
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
still be open if there are any

761
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
further discussions.

762
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Otherwise,

763
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
thank you very much for the

764
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
presentation, which was really very interesting.

765
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And yes, next up is Joachim

766
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Wickel, who is already very active in the chat,

767
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
even with a presentation in German.

768
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And yes, I hope there are still many

769
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
interesting conversations at the conference today.

770
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Again, thank you very much, Udo.

771
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
All right.

772
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:57,000
See you soon. Bye.
