00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello everyone, thank you for joining us in this second day of Matomo Camp.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,440
We will start the day with a very interesting presentation from Johan about Tag Manager

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
and Constant Solutions.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:29,160
Johan is a developer and project lead on web and web analytics since 2012.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,880
He is tech lead for Matomo on the Swedish digital agency Whitespace.

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,240
Today we will learn with him how to handle user consent with Matomo and Matomo Tag Manager.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,920
Johan, I am leaving the floor to you.

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,160
Hello everybody, my name is Johan Westin and I've been working with the web for a very

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,680
long time and I actually started my professional career back in 2004.

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
For the last couple of years I've been working at Whitespace and I've been responsible for

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,320
making sure that tech is working as expected with Matomo.

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,080
I've always been focused on open source software and are trying to push what's possible with

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,320
a free and open platform such as Matomo, it's really, really exciting.

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,320
I've been working with both large and small clients and we always find that they have

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,760
the same questions in how to manage consent on the web pages and also how Matomo handles

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,760
cookies.

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,840
Let's get started.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,840
What is a cookie?

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:53,800
The easiest way to think of it is it's a very, very small file or piece of data stored in

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:02,240
the browser on your computer and only the webpage you are on can actually access that

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,920
data so Google.com can never access cookies for Microsoft.com and vice versa.

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,720
And since a cookie is just a file or when we're talking computer language, a string,

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,160
it can contain almost anything.

24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,280
A very common strategy is to use cookies to store unique identifiers that you can use

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:36,160
to remember if a user has logged in or if they have made a specific choice for instance

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,800
to actually allow the browsers to store cookies.

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,640
Data in the cookies are the only piece of information that can persist between visits

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,880
to a page.

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,520
And it's also important to remember that you can actually steal somebody else's cookie

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,120
if you have access to their network or if you have access to their computer.

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,360
And there was actually a program back in 2010 called Fire Sheep that did exactly that for

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,000
famous social media sites.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,120
Anybody remembers it?

34
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,640
It's actually possible for almost anybody with a little bit of technical skills to look

35
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,560
in the cookie jar.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,300
In most browsers today you can use something called a developer tool to actually look or

37
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,760
delete cookies or create new ones if you want.

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Here we can see free cookies for whitespace.sc and it's a bit small maybe but I've created

39
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:07,360
my own one called Crunchy.

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,720
And this is how you create a cookie within the developer tools or with JavaScript code.

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,000
So it's only one line.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,040
There is of course a lot of more options you can set when creating a cookie but this is

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:39,760
the most basic use case for creating a cookie that will persist within the browser.

44
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:48,440
The information within the cookie is actually sent back to the server on almost on most

45
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:56,280
requests, not all requests, we will learn a little bit more about what requests later.

46
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:04,520
But here we can see an example for how the cookie data is actually sent with the request.

47
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:12,320
It's called an HTTP header and all requests that you are doing to a web page has this

48
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
data with it.

49
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,920
And the server then can use the cookie information to know who is browsing, should they be logged

50
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:42,920
in, is it in an automa context, we are talking about a visitor ID.

51
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,280
So that was a very brief introduction to cookies, let's move on.

52
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,800
We also have consent.

53
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,240
Consent is quite simple but most people get it wrong anyway.

54
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,360
When asking for consent, the user needs to say yes, not saying anything means no and

55
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:14,440
the user should be able to change their mind.

56
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,800
There is a lot of legal requirements related to consent.

57
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,520
I have no interest in delving too deep into that topic right now, we've got a lot of other

58
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:35,420
things to cover but you can actually within Matomo get some very useful links and tips

59
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:41,240
for consent if you are interested in reading more about it.

60
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,600
You will find it under privacy and asking for consent.

61
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:57,880
There is even some links to the GDPR and so forth.

62
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,480
So what kind of cookies does Matomo store then?

63
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:09,280
Well, a bunch, you can say, depending on what plugins you have active, the list might vary.

64
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,200
But these are some of the basic ones that you will see on most sites, at least if you

65
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,920
are using Matomo tag manager.

66
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,520
MTM consent, it's the first one, it's a user preference cookie, it's remembering if the

67
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,920
user has consented to cookies or not.

68
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,720
Remember that storing data in the cookies is the only way to have persistent information

69
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,320
between visits.

70
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:46,080
And so we need to create a cookie for remembering if we are allowed to create cookies.

71
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,200
For some times you also need to create a cookie for when you are not allowed to create cookies.

72
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,040
That's a bit more...

73
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,040
And we also have the PKID cookie.

74
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,760
This is also a Matomo cookie.

75
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:13,000
It's the unique identifier for the visitor or the user when accessing the page.

76
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,880
We also have the PKSES cookie.

77
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:26,040
This cookie stores information about the current visit that the user is doing right now.

78
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,240
And as I said, there are a bunch of other cookies.

79
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,040
It's very easy to find information about this if you look at matomo.org or if you're using

80
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,160
any search engine and search for Matomo and cookies and you will get the more detailed

81
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:54,680
information about what they include.

82
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,480
After saying no to cookies are not enough, Matomo has the ability to let users completely

83
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,200
opt out from any tracking.

84
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:15,480
You can actually add this cookie called Matomo Ignore to keep your own traffic from getting

85
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,260
exposed in the platform.

86
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:26,280
One way to do that is to click on the administration, the small cog in the user interface and then

87
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,880
click personal and then settings and then you have a link saying exclude your visits

88
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
using a cookie.

89
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,640
That will actually help you set this cookie in your browser to ignore all requests coming

90
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
from your browser.

91
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,280
This is a good way to make sure that you as an administrator of the platform don't want

92
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:55,720
to mix up your traffic with all the real visits to the page.

93
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,200
It's also possible in Matomo to enable the do not track header that some browsers have

94
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,720
implemented and are using.

95
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,000
Here we can see a screenshot from Firefox where you can enable that header and say always

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:29,440
or only for sites that I have selected.

97
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,000
Another new feature is that you can create a custom opt out page.

98
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,080
You have had the opt out page in Matomo for a long time but they recently added the ability

99
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,520
to actually add your own styles to that page to make it look more in line with the brand

100
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,080
of the page you're visiting.

101
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:04,120
But this we're getting kind of sidetracked from let's focus back on the tag manager instead.

102
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,440
Now we can handle options.

103
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,320
So a brief introduction, Matomo tag manager, it's a plugin.

104
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:28,380
You actually need to activate the plugin if you're running your own installation of Matomo.

105
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,320
When you activate the plugin, you will see a new selection in the top menu called tag

106
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,640
manager.

107
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:45,600
Tag manager is a way to control custom JavaScript snippets for non-developers.

108
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,800
You still need some technical know how but you can actually create quite a lot of interesting

109
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,200
events and tracking without doing any custom JavaScript.

110
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Each page or property, if you are talking Google Analytics terms, has one or more containers

111
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,880
and container is collection of tags and triggers and variables and a container has the ability

112
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:27,940
to publish many different versions to different environments and each site can actually have

113
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:40,960
a multiple of containers if you want them to.

114
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:48,560
When you click on the tag manager in the top menu, this is the primary scene that we greet

115
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
you.

116
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:58,280
Some of the parts here are on Swedish because this is from a Swedish site.

117
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,280
But you can see the triggers and the tags and different versions and the variables.

118
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Today, we're going to focus more on the variable part and to be even more specific, we're going

119
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:36,880
to focus on a Matomo configuration on the variables.

120
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,480
When clicking on the configuration, a new page is loaded and you are granted access

121
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,920
to all the settings available for that configuration.

122
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,640
Scrolling down in this list, we will find the options or settings related to cookies

123
00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:00,760
and to consent.

124
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:14,280
There are three main options we will be discussing today.

125
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:28,960
We have the disable cookies, require tracking consent and require cookie consent.

126
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,760
It can be a little bit confusing because when you are clicking one of them, for instance,

127
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,200
say that you are clicking disable cookies, require tracking consent and require cookie

128
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,920
consent will actually disappear from the options.

129
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,000
The same is true for selecting require tracking consent and require cookie consent.

130
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,920
If these options are not showing for you, you might already have selected one of them

131
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,120
and you need to unclick that option to get them all.

132
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:24,080
It actually works a little bit more like a radio button than a normal select form.

133
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,880
The first option, disable cookies.

134
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:35,240
This means that all cookies are completely disabled and Matomo doesn't need to store

135
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,560
anything to track the users.

136
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,240
It is possible to activate them again through JavaScript if you want to.

137
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,800
And when we don't use cookies, Matomo will still track the visit, but we won't be able

138
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:03,880
to capture additional details about the visit, such as if it's a returning visitor and information

139
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:23,680
such as that, because we have no idea or no way of knowing if they are returning or not.

140
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,120
Require tracking consent.

141
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:35,160
This means that Matomo won't do any tracking at all until the user has agreed to this.

142
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,240
When selecting this option, some additional JavaScript code needs to be executed and added

143
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:52,120
to the site for when and if a user actually agrees and consents to being tracked.

144
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,120
This will, of course, impact how many visits you get on a page because many users don't

145
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,680
want to, don't really care about the consent or consent options and some users don't even

146
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:19,320
want to be tracked.

147
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,840
The JavaScript code that needs to be executed is displayed here.

148
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,240
It's a small call to the PAQ object.

149
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:37,160
The PAQ object is created by the Matomo tracker JavaScript, and here we are pushing in a new

150
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:47,480
setting or event to that object and telling it to remember that the user has given consent.

151
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,080
There is also another option where we can say set consent given.

152
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,760
That means that for this page view, the user has given their consent.

153
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,640
But for that to work, you need to create your own method of remembering consent because

154
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,280
you don't want to disturb the user on every page load and ask for consent again, again,

155
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:31,680
again.

156
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,840
And then we have the next option, require cookie consent.

157
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,080
This means that we won't, we will still do the tracking, but we won't create and store

158
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:55,400
a cookie in the users' browsers without them actually approving and giving us their consent.

159
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,680
This is the most common solution, at least for us, when we want to record that the page

160
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:11,160
view is happening, but we want to also ask the user if it's okay to store the cookie

161
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,880
and when they say, yes, you can, you are allowed to create a cookie in my browser, then the

162
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:29,160
cookie gets created and then the cookie is stored for at least a couple of weeks or maybe

163
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:48,400
months or all the following page views and return visits to the page.

164
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,820
And that's with the remember consent.

165
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:59,040
We also have the, it's almost the same code that needs to be executed.

166
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,840
You need to execute remember cookie consent given, push that to the PRQ object.

167
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:14,480
There is also a set consent given if you don't want to store this information within a cookie

168
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:23,200
and you need, but then you need to call that set consent given on each page load.

169
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,680
It can be a good option if you have your own consent management solution in place or handling

170
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:47,720
consent in any other way.

171
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,400
Since the chat is lagging behind quite a bit, we learned yesterday, I'm going to answer

172
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,120
all the questions at the end of the session.

173
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:15,440
So please just enter them in the chat and I will try to answer all of them at the end.

174
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,080
So but that's not all, we have more options to go through.

175
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,120
We have, there are also some options related to how the cookie should be created and how

176
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,080
the cookie should be stored.

177
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:38,640
These options are not related to consent, but more related to security, maybe even performance.

178
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,760
Four options we're going to focus in on right now.

179
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,600
First up, we have the secure cookie option.

180
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,880
So what does this even mean?

181
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:57,400
Well, it means that if you're tracking data from sites that are using HTTPS, which you

182
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,920
definitely should, you should enable secure cookies.

183
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:11,240
This will, when a page isn't loaded over a secure channel such as HTTPS, the communication

184
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,880
between your user and the webpage aren't encrypted at all.

185
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:26,520
And doing a cookie hijack, that means that you have a malicious actor on the same network

186
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,480
as the user, then they can actually inspect the traffic flowing over the network and extract

187
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,440
the cookie information from that user.

188
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,960
Or in a Matomo context, that might not be the most important thing because they can

189
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,920
steal a visit ID.

190
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,040
But if you have the ability to log into a site and are sending cookies related to that,

191
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,880
it definitely can be quite bad.

192
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:06,600
So and setting the cookie as secure means that it limits the scope for the cookie.

193
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,300
And limiting the scope means that the said cookie will only be sent over an HTTPS call.

194
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:21,360
So even if the user are trying to access the webpage in a non-HTTPS context, the cookie

195
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,200
won't be sent.

196
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:33,780
This is usually a good idea.

197
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,960
We also have the cookie domain and the cookie path options.

198
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,640
For cookies to work, we need to specify what domain it should be created for.

199
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:55,680
For example, if your webpage uses both www and without World Wide Web in the beginning,

200
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:05,080
you can set the cookie to.widespace.se, for example, and it should work for both domains.

201
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,240
It's also possible to use a tag manager variable here such as page hostname.

202
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,680
This can be very useful for testing purposes when you are using the same tag manager on

203
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:31,880
a stage site and a production site and you want to make sure that everything works.

204
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:40,040
When setting the domain or using this variable, you need to remember that if it's possible

205
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:47,200
to access your website for different domains for some reason, this might create different

206
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,600
cookies and the user might get registered at different user IDs.

207
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,200
Something to keep in mind.

208
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,880
The cookie path option can be used if the site is installed in a subdirectory on the

209
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,560
server.

210
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,440
This will limit the amount of cookies created for that domain and restrict them to just

211
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,440
one subdirectory.

212
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:44,680
Then we have the same site cookie.

213
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:54,520
This is an option for when a cookie should be sent from the browser to the server.

214
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:01,480
This helps the browser to understand when the cookies should be sent to the server or

215
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
not.

216
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,360
There are three options to choose from here.

217
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:13,760
We have the lax, that means do not send a normal cross site sub request, for example,

218
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,760
when loading images or frames.

219
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:24,080
This is the default option in most browsers.

220
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,360
Then we have a more strict approach, that means that cookies will only be sent in the

221
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:37,340
first party context and will not be sent along with requests initiated by third party websites

222
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:44,240
or third party scripts.

223
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,720
And then we have none, this is a bit more like a wild west approach, cookies will be

224
00:26:49,720 --> 00:27:08,840
sent on all requests, in all contexts, images and for cross site requests.

225
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,880
That was all the settings within tag manager to handle cookies.

226
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,840
But there's actually one more important thing, something that Matomo can't really help us

227
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,480
with, and that is removing consent.

228
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,520
The way we do it and the JavaScript code that we need to execute is almost the same as the

229
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:40,400
one we are using when remembering consent, but instead we use forget consent given, and

230
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,440
we use forget cookie consent given.

231
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:52,480
And this is for when the user actually decides by using the consent solution on the webpage

232
00:27:52,480 --> 00:28:01,840
to remove the consent or click the checkbox and I don't want to be tracked anymore.

233
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:23,120
And as with most things related to Matomo, the documentation is really, really good.

234
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,000
And if you want to learn more about tracking consent and how the JavaScript part of it

235
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,120
works, you should definitely check out the documentation.

236
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,600
A big high five to the Matomo team that has created documentation.

237
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,520
It's an excellent documentation for all things, including creating your own plugins and so

238
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,520
forth.

239
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:03,040
And that was it.

240
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,480
That was all my slides.

241
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,640
I was hoping to have a short questions and answers section now for the last couple of

242
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,800
minutes of the talk until the next one.

243
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,640
And I will be monitoring the chat if you have any questions.

244
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,800
Douglas asked earlier, can I decide how long the cookies will be saved?

245
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,760
Of course you can decide how long to save the cookies.

246
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:39,200
As Udo has mentioned, there is options for setting the timeouts.

247
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:48,800
You can also when you implement your own solutions, you can store them when cookies are created

248
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,800
for selecting a good time.

249
00:29:52,800 --> 00:30:01,080
I think that is dependent on the local jurisdictions, what kind of rules apply to the site that

250
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,960
you are using.

251
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,720
But maybe a month or two is a good starting point for most sites.

252
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:16,560
Yeah, Marcus is pointing out, we had a question earlier about third party consent tools and

253
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,320
consent manager.

254
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:28,760
You can also implement them and most consent manager, as Thomas mentioned, stores a cookie

255
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,040
for when the user gives consent.

256
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,440
And some of them have excellent support for Matomo and some you need to actually create

257
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,800
your own small JavaScript snippets for handling cookies.

258
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,080
That is in most cases always when managing cookies, it's always two parts, one in Matomo

259
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,560
and one is in the CMS or on the site that you are implementing, then all sites require

260
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,640
or need their own custom solutions always.

261
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:11,440
And it's very hard to actually get away from that.

262
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,160
Nicholas is also mentioning that he has created a patch to tag manager where he can set the

263
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,200
visitor cookie time directly in the configuration and that sounds awesome.

264
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:35,800
Hopefully that will make it into a future version of tag manager.

265
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:45,600
Thomas is asking if he's not using tag manager, what kind of options does he have then?

266
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,840
All of the JavaScript options that I have shown here today are available within Matomo

267
00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:00,280
without tag manager, but you don't have the ability because those are tag manager options

268
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,520
that I have shown you here to set consent and so forth.

269
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,720
You need to create your own solution when doing that.

270
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,960
Normally, I would say that you can catch me in the corridor or outside, but since we are

271
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,520
having this digital conference, you have to write to me if you have any more questions

272
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:30,560
after we are finished here in the chat or you can drop me an email, joan.westheim.whitespace.se

273
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:42,440
or just talk to some of my colleagues.

274
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
We have another question.

275
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,720
If I remove my consent, is the previously stored data actually removed such as my ID

276
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,080
and my IP address?

277
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,680
It's Michael who's asking.

278
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm guessing he means from Matomo and no, that would not happen.

279
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,500
The thing that gets removed is the actual cookie in your browser.

280
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:13,920
If you want to remove your ID and masked IP address from Matomo, you would need to mail,

281
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,280
I think, or create a support issue with the administrators of Matomo and they can use

282
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:26,480
the GDPR tools within Matomo to actually remove the ID and masked IP address and also what

283
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,920
pages that user accessed.

284
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,840
As I said earlier, I will stick around in this chat room called Tag Manager and Consent

285
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,320
Solutions probably for the rest of the day and if anybody has any questions, just type

286
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,000
them there if it's regarding Tag Manager or Consent.

287
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,720
It would also be possible to jump on a quick hangout or call with me if needed.

288
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,920
If you have any specific questions that you would like to ask in regards to this.

289
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,480
So thank you, everybody.

290
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:11,440
Talk to you later and hope you have a good conference this last day of the week.

291
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
And bye-bye.

292
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:24,740
Thank you.
