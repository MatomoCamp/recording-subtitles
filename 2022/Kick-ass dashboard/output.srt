00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,180
Hello everyone. Thank you for joining another session of MatomoCamp. In this one we have

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,280
Niklas who will tell us more about dashboards in Matomo. Niklas is a web analyst with a

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,760
background in digital marketing and communication. He has worked with Matomo for years supporting

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,960
governmental agencies and businesses in Sweden. Today we'll learn how to get insights and

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:44,720
how to adjust the dashboards in Matomo. Niklas I'm leaving the floor to you.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:54,880
Thank you. Yes. So hi and welcome to my little talk about how to get a kick-ass dashboard

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:02,560
in Matomo. I think my talk is going to be a little bit more straightforward and hands-on

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:11,960
than other talks for example yesterday. And I'm not going to mention anything about code

9
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:19,120
or something like that. So you don't need to know anything about that to master how

10
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:27,760
to get a kick-ass dashboard in Matomo. You just need to master how to drag and drop basically

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:40,760
inside Matomo. Yes and yeah the chat is lagging so I think I'm going to answer questions at

12
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:54,960
the end of my talk. I think that's going to be the best way forward. So this is basically

13
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,680
what I'm going to talk about. Firstly just going to talk a little bit about what the

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:12,160
dashboard in Matomo is and why you should use it. And the main part of the talk is about

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:22,520
how to set up dashboards within Matomo. So I'm going to demo Matomo and I'm going to

16
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:30,660
go through how the dashboard works, the default dashboard like the first dashboard you see

17
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:39,480
when you log in to Matomo. And then I'm going to try to set up two dashboards for different

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:50,200
needs. One for basically for goals and conversions and one for how you can get a dashboard for

19
00:02:50,200 --> 00:03:06,400
your or how to see how your campaigns perform. That's basically it I think. Just a short

20
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:15,200
notice about who I am. Niklas Tarnsett is my name as Silva mentioned. And I'm right

21
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,120
now a web analyst at the Swedish digital agency Whitespace. I think I have worked with Matomo

22
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:33,680
since 2016 and I have been a product owner for Matomo for the largest organization public

23
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:44,600
sector in Sweden. And yeah I have a background in digital advertising and marketing. And

24
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:55,200
I like to try to focus on what kind of actionable insights you can get with the right data so

25
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:11,800
you don't drown in all the data that is available for you. Yeah that's pretty much who I am.

26
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:20,040
So just to talk a little bit about what the dashboard in Matomo is. You can say that it's

27
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,760
like your home page in Matomo. It's the first thing you see when you log into Matomo. And

28
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:36,560
as I mentioned briefly before there is a default dashboard in Matomo that InnoCraft has set

29
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:48,800
up for you. That one you can change and adjust according to your different needs and so forth.

30
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,320
And I think it's around a hundred different widgets or reports you can choose between

31
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:06,280
when you set up or adjust a dashboard in Matomo. So the sky's the limit you can say. So the

32
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:23,880
thing to focus on is which widgets or reports you want to show in a dashboard. And you can

33
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,040
actually create I don't know I don't think it's a limit to how many you can create. Maybe

34
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,440
someone can correct me if I'm wrong there but basically you can create many different

35
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,560
dashboards for different needs and you can for example let your internal stakeholders

36
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:49,600
get one kind of report or dashboard so they can see maybe the overall performance of your

37
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,440
website and maybe your market department need one other kind of dashboard that is more detailed

38
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:08,480
about maybe goals and conversions for different campaigns or how your site perform regarding

39
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:19,000
SEO or something like that. So I think it's quite a neat tool to use and in my experience

40
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:32,600
I think it's not used so much that it should be I think. And the last point here is you

41
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:44,320
can get quite useful data so you can maybe get some more actionable insights regarding

42
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:55,880
how your website perform and maybe what you need to adjust or take action on regarding

43
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:10,520
maybe conversions or how your SEO performance is. So I think it's quite a nice thing to

44
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:20,640
use and definitely something you should look into if you don't have like work with the

45
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:31,800
different dashboards and adjust them to your different needs. That's it about the dashboard

46
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:44,080
in Matomo but the talk is not over yet. I'm gonna demo the dashboard and yeah this is

47
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:58,680
basically what I'm gonna demo I think. So shortly about how the dashboard works in Matomo

48
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:08,280
and the default dashboard that you get. And then these two examples how you can adjust

49
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:19,280
your dashboard for goals and conversions and one for how you can track the campaign performance

50
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:27,720
if you're running a lot of campaigns in other channels like social media or newsletter and

51
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:39,600
so forth. So I'm gonna jump over to Matomo I think. Let's see here. So I choose the right

52
00:08:39,600 --> 00:09:08,280
window. Yes. So this is the dashboard in Matomo. I hope you can see my screen now. And yeah

53
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:18,720
this is the default dashboard when you log in to Matomo for the first time or if you

54
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,240
do it regularly and you haven't adjusted the dashboard or chosen which widgets you want

55
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,840
to see. And I should say this is the dashboard if you're a super user. So I have like some

56
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:46,280
kind of gamification attempt here from InnoCraft to like set up the Matomo. But yes this is

57
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:57,200
the default dashboard and you can actually remove a widget or report how you want to

58
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,560
like if I don't want to have the real time widget. And it's the same principle for every

59
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:16,040
widget that I can remove like this. So it's quite neat and quite adjustable how you can

60
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:25,200
change the visual representation of data in the dashboard. So maybe I don't want this

61
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:35,640
welcome message even it's a nice message to get. Yeah so it's quite long here. And here

62
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:44,480
is all the options you have for the dashboard. And as you can see it's a lot of options for

63
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:56,240
different things. So I'm going to show you how you can maybe create a better dashboard

64
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:06,760
for your needs. So maybe if I just remove all of these widgets. And basically these

65
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:15,920
widgets as they are called are reports that you can find in the left menu here. It's basically

66
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:28,080
the same reports but you can visualize them in the dashboard instead of clicking through

67
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:41,120
the left menu here. So I had a lot of widgets here. So now it's empty. And maybe you want

68
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:54,800
to have some kind of data about how your site is performing. So this KPI metric widget is

69
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:08,560
quite a good widget to use for different needs. And for this I want to show how you can use

70
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:19,480
it to see how much traffic you get to your site and from which sources. So you hover

71
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,360
over here to this little symbol and then you get a lot of options here. The default is

72
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:42,540
visits and as I said I want to show you traffic sources. So now we have four search engines

73
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:50,040
and to get another one you need to do this again. And go down and then I want to have

74
00:12:50,040 --> 00:13:04,320
four visitors from social networks as well. And maybe four visitors from direct traffic

75
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:15,600
or direct entry. And here you can see like a spark line and how many visitors from direct

76
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,420
entry compared to the previous period. And now I have 3rd of November. Maybe I should

77
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:38,760
choose like one month instead, like October. Yes, now it looks better. Yes, so it's quite

78
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:51,240
quick to get like an overall view of how your site performs regarding, oh, sorry, regarding

79
00:13:51,240 --> 00:14:05,680
your site. So I can get like, this is from, there, this is from websites and then maybe

80
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:20,200
this is from campaigns as well. Let's see here. There we have it, visitors from campaigns.

81
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:33,880
So, and now the dashboard is in three columns. I usually prefer to work with two columns.

82
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:41,840
So then you can scroll down here and change dashboard layout to, yes, you can see here

83
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:50,320
you can have just one, two or two, but the first column is wider than the other one.

84
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,440
So yeah, I prefer to work with two so the dashboard don't get cluttered with too much

85
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:10,560
data. Yes, so this is I think much better than the default dashboard that we saw earlier.

86
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:21,920
One more thing or two more things maybe for just this default dashboard. I really like

87
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:37,880
this one, insights and movers and shakers. You can say it's some kind of overall association

88
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:46,760
how or the biggest changes in October compared to September then, because I've chosen that

89
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:57,720
time period. We can see what kind of page titles or page URLs have had the biggest increase

90
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,240
or yeah, in this example, it's just increased, but it's also, sometimes it's maybe a big

91
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:14,760
decrease in traffic to some website, web page on your website. And then you get like, yeah,

92
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:22,920
the percentage here, but in red, if it's decreased then. So it gets like, yeah, from Facebook

93
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:31,420
it increased a lot. And I think it's because our client here had some kind of campaign

94
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:43,320
in social media about this one. This is in Swedish. It's about more collection, waste

95
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:53,840
collection in the municipality Höganästan. So then they can see that the campaign attracted

96
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:17,960
a lot of traffic from Facebook. And then we can also have, if they're using smartphone

97
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:29,400
or desktop or tablet or so. And then that one I want to have here on the right. And

98
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,920
then you can hover scroll. Now you can move your mouse down here and maybe change to pie

99
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:46,920
chart. So this is the device type. Oh, there I go. And then the screen resolution, maybe

100
00:17:46,920 --> 00:18:00,000
it's a good thing to also have. And that one I also want to have as a pie chart. Then you

101
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:12,480
can see, yeah, the smartphone is like, yeah, around 65% for October month. And here we

102
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:22,480
can see which ones are the most common screen resolutions. And that's a quite, yeah, it's

103
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:30,040
not like so much insights you can get from that, but it's a nice thing to know, like

104
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,200
a hygiene factor for your website that the website performs as you want it to perform

105
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:47,160
in these screen resolutions and that it performs well on smartphone then. So like this page

106
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:59,660
should be very good in the mobile, especially as it was quite a big increase from last month.

107
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:13,720
And this is one way to adjust your dashboard so it gets, I think, more easier to interpret

108
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,920
and easier to digest the data and maybe get more relevant data. And the next thing, if

109
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:31,240
you want to have this as your default dashboard, you can actually go down here and pick this

110
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:46,640
one, set as default widget selection. And you can click yes there. And I forgot to mention

111
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:58,560
the dashboard is connected to the user, like the user account. So this is for me then when

112
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:07,280
I log into Matomo. But if you want your colleagues to have the same dashboard, you can actually

113
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:17,640
copy it, copy the dashboard to user and then select which user should have the dashboard.

114
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,080
But it's quite important to know that if you change your dashboard, you need to do a new

115
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:36,920
copy of the dashboard to your colleagues. Yeah, this is one way to adjust the default

116
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:54,680
dashboard. So I'm going to create a new one, create a new dashboard. And it goes, oh, goes

117
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:06,840
and conversions. And then you can choose if the dashboard should populate with a default

118
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:14,200
dashboard or just an empty dashboard. And I choose empty so I don't need to remove all

119
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:25,600
of the widgets. And then I click add a widget. And for this size, I'm going to again use

120
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:47,960
this KPI metric widget. I'm going to create a lot of KPI widget here. So yeah, this is

121
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:59,960
a start. And then I also want to change the layout, change dashboard layout. Something

122
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:09,920
like this. And now I want to visualize how my goals are performing on the website. So

123
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:21,560
for this is this is for our client NSR. So I want to have one that shows all the conversions

124
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:35,840
on the website. And then maybe one with conversion rate. See if I can find that one there. Conversion

125
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:45,240
rate. So this is kind of like the overall performance regarding all the conversions

126
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:58,760
on the website. And now I want to have for each of the goals. So I scroll down here.

127
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:12,440
This is one goal. The goal is in Swedish, but it says login to my pages. And I want

128
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:30,320
the same but for conversion rate as well. There you have that. And the next goal. Yeah,

129
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:53,280
now I need to create a new one. Yes. So now you have just a dashboard for how your goals

130
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:02,800
are performing or in this example how our client's goals are performing. This is the

131
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:10,600
overall for all conversions. And it has increased. But as you can see the conversion rate is

132
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:20,960
down but not as much. That can maybe one explanation is like the traffic to the site increased

133
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:32,520
a lot but maybe not the rate of how many converted on the website. And this is for login to my

134
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,920
pages and the conversion rate and here the conversions and the conversion rate for the

135
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:54,200
next goal. So I think it's a nice feature to use the dashboard to adjust it and show

136
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:03,720
it for your colleagues. Like this one I should think the market department is quite interested

137
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:13,840
in. So you can use it to yeah you can do like this as well and then use this link to send

138
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:30,000
it to your colleagues. Yes. And the last one I want to show is a dashboard for campaign

139
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:49,280
performers. So I'm going to create a new dashboard. Sample of campaign performance. I'm going

140
00:25:49,280 --> 00:26:00,760
to choose to leave it empty. Then I'm going to add a widget. And again I'm going to use

141
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:15,200
KPI metric and some other widgets as well. But we start with KPI metric. And yes I forgot

142
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:28,720
this one I want to have just as one column. I think you're going to understand why shortly.

143
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:47,480
So we're going to create more KPI widgets here. Something like this. And I want to have

144
00:26:47,480 --> 00:27:00,600
this one visitors from campaigns. And I also want to have the percentage from campaigns.

145
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:12,280
Presenter visitors from campaigns. And I also want to have data for SEO traffic. Because

146
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:20,640
campaigns often affect your SEO or traffic that comes from search engines. Because it's

147
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,440
not always the user clicks on the link on like social media directly. Maybe they Google

148
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:41,040
it later or something like that. So then I want to have visitors from search engines.

149
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:57,120
And also direct traffic. Like all other traffic that Motomo can't identify basically. And

150
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:13,120
I want to have let's see here. Yes this one under acquisition campaigns and then campaign

151
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:29,160
names. And I want to have that one in the bottom of the dashboard like this as well.

152
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:42,320
And I think a couple of releases of Motomo or some releases lately released the ability

153
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:52,280
to show the spare table with goals metrics. So I think I'm going to do that. So yeah this

154
00:28:52,280 --> 00:29:02,320
is in October so they had just two campaigns. And if you regard conversions for goals that

155
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,160
I had set up it wasn't so successful. But I actually don't know what the campaigns were

156
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:19,280
about but here you can get a glimpse of how the campaigns perform regarding your goals

157
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:33,000
that you have set up in Motomo. And you also get how the traffic to the website from the

158
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,880
campaigns for October. And also how the traffic from search engines and direct entry was for

159
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:59,120
October month. And this one is quite easy to grasp I think. And again it's something

160
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:12,120
maybe the market department is interested in to look at how their campaigns have performed

161
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:24,400
for a given period and see if it gave theirs the effect that they wanted or if it was just

162
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:36,160
basically a waste of time. So now I've just chosen like campaign names but you can also

163
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:44,480
see if you want if you see how it performed based on which source the traffic came from

164
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:52,040
like if it was Facebook or a newsletter or something like that. And then you can also

165
00:30:52,040 --> 00:31:06,760
add let's see here acquisition and campaigns. And then you can take campaign source medium.

166
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:17,160
And you can yeah I'll put it here. Yeah it was a newsletter they sent out. But here again

167
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:29,880
you can change to goals metrics. Yes and here you have the campaign names. So yeah for this

168
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:39,920
example it's maybe not so relevant but if you communicate in different channels I think

169
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:48,880
it's quite neat to have one widget for your source medium as well to see if it was Facebook

170
00:31:48,880 --> 00:32:00,440
or Instagram or a newsletter as in this example that performed best. Not performed best like

171
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:14,080
in visits but in conversions if that was your intent with the campaign. Yes I think it was

172
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:25,120
all that I had to show I think. Let me see here. Yeah I'll leave it there. So I don't

173
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:34,080
know if someone. Yeah I got a question here from Marcus. Is there any frequently asked

174
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:43,000
question from users transitioning from Google Analytics? Yeah well one question is how they

175
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:56,000
can get like the easy dashboard or visualization of data in Google Analytics. How they can

176
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,560
have the same in Matomo. And my answer is this is the closest you can get to like Google

177
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:11,440
Analytics have some similar solution. Like when you see the numbers you see the sparkline

178
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:21,080
and you see the comparison from the previous period. That's one question they have. One

179
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:29,640
common one that I don't have any good solution on is like secondary dimension. Or you can

180
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:37,800
if it's possible to use that in Matomo. And I don't think it's possible without some customized

181
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:52,840
code if I'm correctly. Maybe someone else have a better answer that. Yeah and got another

182
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:01,480
question from Diana. Is it possible to embed the dashboard in an external website? Yes

183
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:18,200
that's possible. You can use. Yes the short answer is yes. You can do that. I think I

184
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:27,320
think like adjusted dashboard in Matomo is very good for people that have not have not

185
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:38,000
the analyst skills that most of you have. Like you don't need to have an external tool

186
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,080
to get like some kind of improvement of the visualization in Matomo. But this is for like

187
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:59,760
the basic the basic things I think. Yeah I don't I can't I can't see any more questions

188
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:08,600
in the chat room. But if you have any questions regarding this you can always email me if

189
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:23,440
you want to. I'll write my email in the chat here. Yeah I think I'm going to say goodbye

190
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:39,240
and thank you for your time. Bye.
