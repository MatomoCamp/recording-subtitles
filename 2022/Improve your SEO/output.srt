00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Okay. So, hi everyone. Thank you for being here and joining us for this presentation

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,720
about how to improve your SEO with Matomo. We're going to be two people here today. There

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:25,000
is Thomas Zeithamel from Germany. Hi Thomas. Hi, thank you. And myself, Jean-Marc Courtiard

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,920
from France. And we are very happy to be here and share with you how we use Matomo to improve

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,040
our SEO strategies and tactics. And as you can see, we've been working in SEO for a few

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,520
years now, for something like 20 years, and very happy to use Matomo for this as well.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,520
And so now what we're going to do during this session is to first introduce why SEO can

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,560
be used with Matomo, how you can use Matomo for your SEO, and this, and go through the

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,560
different tools and tactics that you can use to improve your SEO with Matomo. And the way

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,240
we see it is that Matomo is some kind of a new tool for most of SEO practitioners most

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,920
of the time. And so this presentation is addressed to them, I mean, to SEO professionals who've

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,840
been working with Google Analytics for a long time and want to move to Matomo to increase

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,760
their potential or also to, they have to move to it because the clients are using now Matomo

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,000
and they have to get their hands into it. And I also, we both use Matomo for SEO, and

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,600
we know many people in this arena, and now everybody's switching a lot to Matomo, which

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,440
is grant. And so this presentation is for them, but it's also for Matomo consultants

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,600
who are maybe interested in SEO like this, and as well for curious people, if you want

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,160
to know more how to use Matomo and SEO altogether. And yeah, and one of the things which is very

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,920
important is that we will see how to use Matomo for your SEO. And in the case of SEO tactics

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,640
and how you can do some recurring follow up, how you can measure technical content or net

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,640
linking fields and tasks with Matomo. And it's also intended to work with SEO audits

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:15,720
consultants who need very deep technical information to carry on their audits. And so this presentation

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,880
is shared in three parts. The first one being the new data points in Matomo. The second

24
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,360
is how to use plugins with Matomo to improve your SEO. And the last one is about reporting.

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,120
Now let's move on to the first point, which is the new data points in Matomo. And Thomas

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,520
is going to take this point now.

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:43,360
Thank you, Jean-Marc. I hope you'll see my screen now. Yes, new data points for SEO.

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,320
Why is it important? So the first is that we have some metrics for SEO, for example,

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:58,520
the keywords, the visitor sources, and also many metrics we measure with the Matomo systems

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,720
and it's important for SEO. For example, the bounce rate or the time on site, it's depends

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,520
or is a factor in the, for example, in the Panda updates in Google. So we will pay attention

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:20,640
to this metrics, but it would be better when you can combine Matomo with your data-driven

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:30,440
SEO. I think we have many, many tasks we will think about it. For example, Google is taken

34
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:39,160
to a mobile first approach in 2018. So I think it's very interesting to check up how is the

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,760
behavior of your mobile users and so on to dedicate the duplicate content or think content

36
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,600
is very interesting for SEO because you want to indicate the poor quality sites and also

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,080
the user behavior in time on site, bounce rate, page impressions, all this are factors

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
for Google, which you can also measure with the Google Chrome browser. So what I want

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:13,280
you to tell why we don't, why we do need more data points in this is that we can make a

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:21,360
better data-driven SEO with Matomo. So you have the slides after this presentation, you

41
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,280
can download it and see it. I think it's the entry point. It's not so important what I

42
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,440
talk about, but what I think is very important that you must use data points or they're using

43
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,600
no data points because you want to see something in Matomo, which you can help to improve your

44
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:48,880
SEO. For example, look for mobile-friendly issues. So we have content tracking in this

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,800
case, so we can decide if a viewport is seeing this content log or not and so on. Ability

46
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,040
the usability backs, for example, also in some differences about the mobile version

47
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,440
or the desktop version. So we can measure this data in Matomo and you can build segments

48
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,400
to switch and compare this information. Find important blogs, which are seen very often

49
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:28,080
or identify the operation errors on something else. And the most part of finding the most

50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:37,400
part of SEO in my SEO audits by using Matomo is to find thin content. So that's the reason

51
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,480
I want to do data points in Matomo. So we have three sources which are very underrated

52
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,400
and it's in the Matomo standard. You don't need any new plugins or something else. It's

53
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,760
in the standard. You can use it anymore, but you will setting up this information. So the

54
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,160
first is the custom dimension. You must switch the plugin on and you can use it. You have

55
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,840
five custom dimensions per visit or per action on the sites. You have events. You can tracking

56
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,400
some click events, scrolling and so on. Or for example, the content viewing. In the content

57
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,720
tracking, you can measure the views and the interactions on specific elements, for example,

58
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,840
the footer or something else. So these three are very important and underrated factors

59
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,640
to improve your SEO. First, the custom dimension. With the custom dimension, you can give some

60
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:44,680
information from your content management system to Matomo. And it's very useful to give more

61
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:52,200
data to Matomo, which you can split and make in the reports and you can segment this data

62
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:02,880
and so on. And for example, I have many helpful SEO metrics I can transport to Matomo. And

63
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,480
this information, you can read it out of your page or something else. For example, the helpful

64
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,640
dimensions are the release date. Why it's important. With the release date, you can

65
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,840
see when you have a new article on your blog, for example, you can see, oh, in the first

66
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,520
three, two, three months, it's very valuable. It's very high traffic site or something,

67
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,720
but the interest goes going down. And you can think about it. If it maybe you have duplicate

68
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,840
content problems or something, you can switch it to a no index page or the site type. You

69
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,600
can say, for example, this is a product page and what the bounce rate on all the product

70
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:52,120
pages in the in comparison of the category pages or something else. Also structures,

71
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,680
data, departments, page regions. So I think it's very useful that you use the dimensions.

72
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,020
So you can add the dimension in the admin interface in Matomo and you should give the

73
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,160
information over, for example, a push to Matomo in the tech manager, for example. So, and

74
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,480
there are some other information you can give to Matomo or can transport it. The SEO metrics,

75
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:27,280
which are very helpful for a better understanding of the problem of issues of something else,

76
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,920
which can help you to make a good SEO audit for your site. So, for example, the count

77
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,720
of headlines when you see, oh, I have 20 headlines on a site. You can think about it or the content

78
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:47,560
length. I mean, not the content length with all the HTML, but I think about the word counts.

79
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,600
I have an example for you. By using the tech manager, you can create a variable and you

80
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:05,040
can parse the complete HTML source. And I have to write a little script. Maybe you can

81
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,760
do it better, but it can be a help that we can count the words in the content. So in

82
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,560
the first step, I extract only the content in the main content. And this in a HTML, I

83
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:27,520
remove the HTML and count the words. For better reading in Matomo, I make a range of about

84
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,560
50 to make an arrangement that I can read it better. That's quite a little script, which

85
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,240
I use in the tech manager that I can transport the information, how many words on my content

86
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:52,000
site to Matomo. How does it look like? This is an example. You see, I have many sites

87
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,440
with 350 words or 500 words or 450 words. And in the dimensions, you can drill down

88
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:07,960
and see, for example, the information about the bounce rate. And when I use the plus symbol,

89
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:16,080
I can switch and see every URL and I see every bounce rate or the double times on a time

90
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:24,640
on site on every URL. And in this case, I see, oh, I have only three or five words in

91
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,960
this case, but I see the double times on this site are 50 minutes or 30 minutes or 20 minutes.

92
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:42,520
So many content, 450 words, it's not so, but maybe some images there and also, but I have

93
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:50,040
one, which is a breaker. It's only seven seconds on the site. And I can see, oh, it's maybe

94
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,800
there are some potential problems with the site. And that's the reason I use it for example,

95
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,840
to find thin contents, to find a site with low content or with not so many content that

96
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,120
Google can build a relevance to some search phrases.

97
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,520
And if I can add a few things, a few words about what you're doing here with this script,

98
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,280
it's very interesting because in this case, it means that you can do this directly in

99
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,080
Matomo instead of having to crawl the website and to cross the data with your Matomo or

100
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,200
former Google Analytics instance information.

101
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Yes. And you see it only for the sites which are also visited. So it's one of a big part

102
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,760
in SEO audits is when you use a crawler and you have a 1 million page crawl, 1 million

103
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,600
are not visited at any time. So you have only 2,000, 3,000 sites which are visited and disinformations

104
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,800
about bounce rate or time on site are only measured in some analytics systems.

105
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,560
So the next part is that also underrated are the events. So GR4 is moving to track all

106
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:12,720
with events. But also in Matomo, it's not so very often, but we have it. We have events

107
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:20,880
and we can split it into, I think, two sections. For the first time, the technical issues.

108
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,520
Maybe you have a 404 site. Please don't forget to move when you have raised the error or

109
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:37,120
see it on the page. Maybe you have a 404 page that you also triggered an event that he said,

110
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:48,160
oh, there's a 404 error occurred. Or 500 mistakes and so on. Or no results pages if you have

111
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,560
no values for the search, for the internal search. And we have events on the page side.

112
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,680
So it's, for example, if your content is read. Yeah. So you also can events and events, for

113
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,400
example, the scroll def or something else. You can also measure this points. Or if when

114
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,600
we can read in the RTML source, for example, if a product is sold out, so it's not available,

115
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,920
for example, you can send it also to as an event to Matomo and see how often does it

116
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,440
appear. Yeah. And also click events. And also in this, I have a tip for you to build a big

117
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,800
measuring plan because it's very important that you use, in this case, you use for SEO

118
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:45,920
so many events you want to see. For example, when you want some arguments which you want

119
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,600
to improve your SEO and you will say, it's not needed to have this read more button.

120
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,600
We only need the first link. It's the title link with some relevant info for the target

121
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,720
page and read more is not a very good anchor text. So you can remove it because you have

122
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,960
to data and say, oh, just the title clicked a thousand times and read more button is clicked

123
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,480
only 10 times. So you have more or the better SEO argument for your presentation, for your

124
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,960
information, for your, for your better argument for your implementation of your SEO tactics

125
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:30,160
or SEO improvement. Yeah. So I think it's very important. Also similar products. Yeah.

126
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,120
If there is clicks on the similar products in a product page, you can see, oh, we have

127
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,440
thousand product page insights and we have some, some similar products on the side, but

128
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,960
nobody click it. Maybe it's not relevant enough. Maybe we should change the strategy. Maybe

129
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:56,880
the, the, the, the, yeah, the, the, the output is not so really good. Maybe the place is

130
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,080
not the right place and so on and so on. And so you can say, let us test us if it is better

131
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:13,040
in this form or this, and you can take many of this data to improve your SEO arguments.

132
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,360
So this I have for, for example, we have a carrier portal and we want to see how people

133
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,520
are switching from carrier section to the normal company side. And also I can see how

134
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,720
many people are switching from one point to another point and have measured this with

135
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:39,440
the events. Yeah. And to see how the people are interacting and can say, did we need a

136
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:49,440
normal site or did we follow the siloing navigation, for example. So it can be very helpful. The

137
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:57,160
next part also is like the event tracking is the content tracking. Yeah. So for it's,

138
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,160
for me, it's very important that I see how the headline structure is, is in the document

139
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:12,280
and the headline structure can be good to see, or if you can use this to find non-use

140
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:20,840
elements or for a better understanding how the site is, the navigation is on the site,

141
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:28,360
the scroll teeth or something else. And it's in the content tracking, it's very hard for

142
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,280
me and many times with my customers to implement the section. So, and this is also a good point

143
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:42,320
that we can use the tech manager at the moment. So the tech manager also, I have the custom

144
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:53,160
HTML and can use a script and the script does nothing else. I only get all the H2 or headline

145
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,880
two format. And on this headline two format, I give the information. What is the headline

146
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:10,800
in text? So I see every headline and I give the URL also as the content piece to Matomo.

147
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:18,080
And when you use this script, all your headlines with the headline two format will report to

148
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,760
Matomo which blog is seen or not seen. And it's very interesting because you can see,

149
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,320
you have to write order on the site and you can see, for example, we have 900 page impressions

150
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:41,120
and the navigation is seen 880 times and part of the website analysis are seen only 500

151
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,960
times and so on and so on. And you can drill down and see what is, which element is all

152
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:56,080
also seen or in the viewport. It's very interesting to see this information for a special landing

153
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,760
page, for example, and help you to make your SEO better. And the next in the content tracking

154
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:10,440
is also the footer, measure the footer. It's the best tip, I think, because everybody who

155
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:19,680
read the content, when he read it to the end, then the footer is displayed in the viewport.

156
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:29,840
And you can say it's not really the 100% but much part of all the users which see the content

157
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:38,480
footer, see the footer, are reading the content to the end. And you can say I have 100 page

158
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:48,960
impressions but only 10 users see the footer and it gives you a little bit of understanding

159
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:57,240
how many users read this content until the end. And don't forget segments. So segments

160
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:05,760
are a very useful part in Matomo and you can say, for example, dividing the devices, the

161
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:14,000
goals, the channels, the user type, if new user or a queuing user. You can with the comparison

162
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,760
of this, you can find more issues which can help you to make your site better. For example,

163
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,200
if your site is mobile-friendly, you build a segment with the mobile users and you use

164
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,480
a segment with the desktop users and make a comparison of this. And when you see all

165
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:42,160
the usability values in the time on site or the bounce rate is very different, then you

166
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,800
can see maybe it's some mobile-friendly issues or usability issues or maybe on many sites

167
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,720
we have hidden content. And in the Google search essentials, it's the new declaration

168
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,960
of the Google Webmaster guidelines. It's also a part in it that you say we have read the

169
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:10,880
hidden content, yes, but we also make some relevance to it, but how many we don't know.

170
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,480
But it's very interesting to see if there are difference about the mobile section and

171
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:26,960
the desktop section. And you can see how the site will be navigation and so on parts in

172
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:35,680
your site. So a little summary for this section, dimensions, events, and the content measurement

173
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,760
can help you for your SEO decisions because you have the data and can say this is the

174
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:49,040
reason why you have SEO arguments for your decisions or you can make things. You can

175
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,400
find also potential. You can find the content. You can find something else here. You can

176
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:03,240
find problems with the usability and so on. You have better argumentation for the implementation

177
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,680
of SEO tests or something else because you have the data then you can measure these values

178
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:18,360
in Matomo. And at last, you can also monitor your SEO measurements. So another trick, dimensions

179
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,160
you use, for example, you can import. John Mark is telling you about this plugin, but

180
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:34,680
you can take your search engine keywords to resolve the not provided solution. But on

181
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:42,920
this you can see how many people are, for example, using the CTR. And you can change

182
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,480
your title. You can change your description and see it how it works on the high traffic

183
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,760
sites. And high traffic sites means that you have many page impressions. And you can see

184
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:01,200
also if the bounce rate is going up or down where you take some changes. So I think I

185
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:09,800
hope this was very helpful for you. It's a part of mine. And now go back to John Mark.

186
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,960
Yeah, thank you, Thomas. This is indeed very interesting. When we built this presentation,

187
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,480
there are many things we were discussing. And this was, yeah, all these parts are very

188
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,080
interesting as it's most of the time we undervalue the Matomo or the, I mean, the analytic solution

189
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,820
to proceed with SEO. And in this case, we can see that there are so many, many features

190
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:39,680
in Matomo that can help you so much. And yeah, it was a pleasure to discuss this. By the

191
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,480
way, is my sound okay? Or is there still a problem with it? Because we had a problem

192
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
with it.

193
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes, I think it's perfect. Yes.

194
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:54,480
Okay, cool. Thanks. And by the way, one small digression. I would like to thank Ronan Chardonnay

195
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,600
because he's the one who introduced us together and said, maybe you could do some presentation

196
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:08,560
altogether with this SEO theme. So yeah, that's great. Now let's share my screen and let's

197
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,240
move on to this second part of this presentation, which is plugins.

198
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,480
These plugins in Matomo are a very powerful way to get even in-depth information about

199
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,800
your SEO and about many, many things. They really extend the functionalities of Matomo.

200
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,760
If you take, for instance, WordPress, you can take WordPress.org and you get plugins

201
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,120
on your WordPress.org, I mean, on your self-hosted WordPress. And it's the same in here. You

202
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,880
can get even more functionalities with these plugins, which is something that doesn't exist

203
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
in the Google Analytics one.

204
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,440
So now let's start with custom reports. And one catch about this, the custom reports is

205
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:57,320
a functionality which at first was already present in Google Analytics. In this case,

206
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,320
in Matomo, it depends on the instance that you take. Whether it's on-premise, you have

207
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,400
to pay for it, or whether it's Matomo Cloud. And in this case, it's included in your Matomo

208
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,320
instance. So the custom reports are just like what you already know. I mean, they help you

209
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,120
to get to cross dimensions, I mean, several dimensions and several metrics altogether

210
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,840
so that you can get even more complete, comprehensive information regarding what you want to do.

211
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,880
So this is what we can do here with SEO. For instance, you can try to figure out which

212
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,720
page URL and page title have altogether. You can check traffic or engagement figures, KPIs

213
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,960
altogether with all this stuff. And we can check this out just like quickly. I mean,

214
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,240
I won't share this now because I guess it's going to shut down. You won't see my screen

215
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,800
anymore. But we will, I guess, let this link here. And by the way, the link is basically

216
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,520
the Matomo demo site. And if you go on Matomo demo, just search this on your favorite search

217
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,120
engine and you will find the demo site of Matomo. And just go to custom reports, which

218
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,920
is at the bottom of the interface. And as I said, there is a price for it. I mean, it's

219
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,220
included in the cloud, but you have to pay for it if you want to get it on-premise or

220
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:30,040
for WordPress. And one trick about that is that this custom reports, it's a small digression

221
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:36,760
by the way, this custom reports plugin helps you get information, but it takes the data

222
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,320
from the moment you have created your custom report. So if you want to get data back from

223
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,320
an historical point of view, you have to use another plugin, which is called Invalid Reports.

224
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,520
Here it is. And in this case, Matomo will calculate again all these reports regarding

225
00:25:51,520 --> 00:26:01,560
your historical data. The other plugin that we mentioned here is the User Flow. As practitioners

226
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,480
of analytics, you obviously know this kind of plugin, I mean, this kind of functionality.

227
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,120
In this case, it's a plugin. And the way we use it with SEO is that when we use it with

228
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,520
a segment, it's very important to use it with a segment obviously. If you want to get your

229
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:25,760
organic search information, you will see where people come from, and you see here in red

230
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,680
the drop of people from one part of your website to another part, another part, another part.

231
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,240
And this is where you can think about, okay, there is a problem with this part, and this

232
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,960
is where people come from, etc. I mean, this is something that you already know if you've

233
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,880
been doing analytics for a while, so I won't talk too much about it, but I would say it's

234
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,400
pretty obvious. And there is another plugin that looks a bit like this. We will talk about

235
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,920
this later. It's called Transition, and it looks pretty similar to it, but it goes even

236
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,120
more deeper. It goes deeper into this. And the User Flow is, again, included in the Matomo

237
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,080
Cloud instance, and you have to pay for it if you want, as it's a plugin, if you want

238
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,200
to use it on-premise. And as I said, you have to use it with SEO organic search segments.

239
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,800
And one thing we'll catch about the segments is that they are not created out of the box,

240
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,960
not available out of the box when you're using Matomo. What happens is that you have to create

241
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,120
them. So when you create your instance in Matomo, and here in this case, I'm talking

242
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,080
to people who don't know Matomo yet and want to use it for their SEO, you have to create

243
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,200
this segment, your organic segment, directly, very quickly, so that you can get information

244
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,000
about your organic search traffic. Now, let's move on to another plugin, which is called

245
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,520
Search Engine Keywords Performance. So this one looks like this. You have many, many tables

246
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,600
and graphics and graphs, et cetera. It's a very, again, powerful tool. Thomas, you mentioned

247
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,720
it before, and the point of this tool is that you will connect your Google Search Console

248
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:12,360
or Bing Webmaster Tools or Yahoo or Yandex to Matomo. And Matomo will grab the data from

249
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,340
those tools through their respective APIs and get them into your Matomo. And what is

250
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,800
interesting about that is that you will get the same information than those you get into,

251
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:31,680
for instance, Search Console, the keywords, CTR, et cetera, et cetera, given that not

252
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,320
every information is available in those tools. We know that, for instance, Search Console

253
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,280
doesn't show you every keyword which are used by people to access your website. But anyway,

254
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,600
this is what you're going to get. And you're going to get also information about images,

255
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,320
you know, on Google Images or Google Videos, for instance, as well, and also the information

256
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,520
that you would get in Google Search Console regarding the Googlebot crawling accesses,

257
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,720
et cetera, the errors and everything. And what is good to know is that what is good

258
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,760
about this plugin is that you will keep an historical data recording of your Search Console

259
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,080
directly into your Matomo instance, which is great because in this case, you can get

260
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,160
like many years of a Search Console information if needed, given that you won't maybe need

261
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,600
something like two years of information for two years ago. But I guess that's okay. And

262
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,440
yeah, I think that's okay. But just one thing is just one catch, again, is that it does

263
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,840
not allow to match visitors to request. So in this case, Matomo doesn't do that, which

264
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,760
is a bit tricky somehow. But that's the way it works. So you don't get sometimes all the

265
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,460
information to get everything but visits with the visitors, right? And yeah, again, it's

266
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,520
included in the Matomo cloud. And it's a yeah, you have to pay for it if you want to get

267
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,560
it into your instance. But it's great. In this case, the third plugin we will talk about

268
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:07,720
is as your Web Vitals. Okay, so I'm rushing a bit in this case. So this but I think it's

269
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,220
important if we if we have Q&A. So this third plugin is about to get information regarding

270
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:20,120
your performance. You know, we talked about Web Vitals about Google putting this up to

271
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:26,920
the front. And in this case, this is how you can measure your performance with with Matomo.

272
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:35,280
What this plugin will do is that it will connect to your Google page speed insight API and

273
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:42,160
gather data regarding the five top traffic relevant pages on your website. Otherwise,

274
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:49,080
we take a lot of data regarding the API. And if you don't want this to be too heavy, you

275
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:56,040
have to focus on the five top pages. Anyway, you can also add more pages manually to your

276
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:02,560
instance. This is written here. It's possible to choose specific pages. And yeah, that's

277
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,920
great tool. And it's a bit like what we find in screaming fraud when we want to get data

278
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,720
from screaming fraud and cross cross them with Google page speed insight. And this is

279
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,520
how then you that you can measure your your performances, you will get every information

280
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,160
regarding your the API, etc. And all the other everything that makes your website slow and

281
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,760
then you can improve the best the best pages and the top traffic driven pages. Okay. I

282
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:39,080
don't know if somebody's got questions about this, by the way. Okay. Oh, it's fine. Yeah.

283
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,160
Okay. And now let's move on to the reporting. Okay. The Matomo you have many functionalities

284
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:53,240
to get reportings. One thing, though, it's that Matomo is not probably the yet the best

285
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,340
solution to get data visualization. We have to be fair about this, I guess. But there

286
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,160
are still many, many things you can do within it. And the point of this, of this part of

287
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,600
the presentation is to show you the native reports, data visualization tools that you

288
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,360
get and also the the other functionalities and plug in data visualization functionalities

289
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:23,440
as well. Okay, bye. At first, we can mention the segments. We talked about this many times.

290
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,720
These slides just to show you how to create a segment with the organic search in Matomo.

291
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,760
You have to choose the channel type and go to search. And this is how you're going to

292
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,800
get your organic search like you used to do in previous in previous analytic tools. Then

293
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,800
there is the acquisition channels. In this case, you can get just like you used to do

294
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:53,360
in all the solutions, the acquisition channels being spread around and taken apart. I mean,

295
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,960
breaking, sorry, broken down in depending if it's search engine, direct traffic, etc.

296
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,160
referrals, etc. And which is it's something that is obviously important when you want

297
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,760
to measure your SEO performances compared to the other channels, which are driving traffic

298
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,840
to your website. There's also what I mentioned before, the transitions, the transitions are

299
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,240
a way to get information regarding where people come from, where people come from on your

300
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,520
website. I mean, the incoming traffic regarding the different channels. And you can see where

301
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,400
how many people have stayed on the website and where they went and how many have went.

302
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:39,160
I've quit your website on certain pages. And this is it's very malleable. I mean, you can

303
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,240
change the page URL, the URL, the titles, etc. and see where people come from, from

304
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:52,220
certain search engines and then go to certain pages, etc. All right. I'm hurrying up. It's

305
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:59,280
almost done. We also get, just like in Google Analytics, the site search. It's a relevant

306
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,080
tool to get information about what people are interested in and are looking for on your

307
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:12,000
website. And again, you can get all this information here, like all the terms they've been looking

308
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,800
for and on which page. And there are also other tools that you can use to see your data.

309
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,240
In this case, you have the landing page report. It's something that I use a lot when I do

310
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:33,240
SEO audit, because in this case, you can get the landing pages where people arrive on which

311
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,320
page they arrive on your website. And it's something you can find again in Matomo. There

312
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,600
is duplicate title. Again, you can see this and see if you have any problems with the

313
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:50,120
titles. And this goes, again, with the parts that Tomas mentioned before and about the

314
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:59,200
H1, 2, etc. It's everything in here is complimentary to get your technical SEO proper. There are

315
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,880
also Google Search Console information, as we mentioned before in the search engine keywords

316
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,960
performance plugin and SEO Web Vitals, again, in this. You can get as well to make something

317
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:19,120
very practical, broken links or 404 or 500 errors on your website using exactly the search

318
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:26,000
engine keywords performance plugin in the crawl errors. And in this case, we have the

319
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,800
screenshot of the demo site of Matomo, where you can see that you can get all these 404

320
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,520
errors on the website. And that's great, because in this case, you can quickly wear there.

321
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,960
And finally, the data export. And it's very important to mention that Matomo has extensive

322
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,520
or comprehensive data export features. In this case, you can export your information

323
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:01,980
with as CSV files or CSV for Excel, XML, but also JSON, HTML, RSS. Yeah, RSS looks pretty

324
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:09,320
cool because you can get information on the web page. I mean, using a plugin on RSS client,

325
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,720
for instance. And you can do many, many things. And obviously, it's very important to do that.

326
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,280
I mean, to export your data into your own tools. And in this case, if you export data

327
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,120
on your own in a spreadsheet, it's obvious that you have to manage them a bit. It's like

328
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,560
what you get from other tools. And you have to make sure that you have to change a bit

329
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,120
the layout of the information to make them more relevant, to change the colors, delete

330
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,360
certain columns, just like you would do in Screaming Frog or maybe with Google Analytics.

331
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:50,400
And you also have to change the average time spent. Because, for instance, in this case,

332
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,040
this time is measured in seconds. So you have to do some calculations to get it in minutes

333
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,880
by the time. You can also export your data to Data Studio, which is very important. We

334
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,040
have customers who are very data-driven. I mean, they use Data Studio a lot. By the way,

335
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,000
the name has changed a few days ago. And now, OK, anyway, there is a plugin for that. You

336
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,240
have to pay for it every month. And you can give them your data from Matomo into Data

337
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,800
Studio. It's important. You can also use spreadsheets like Google Sheets, for instance, or LibreOffice

338
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,840
Calc to get data. But I will mention this here directly with the API. And there are

339
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,000
also dedicated dashboards in Matomo. It's a very important feature. And in this case,

340
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,720
you can get all the data you want to measure, especially for your SEO, and compare the bounce

341
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,160
rates, et cetera, the evolution, where people are coming from, through widgets that you

342
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:54,480
can get into your Matomo. And I'm hurrying up again about this stuff. Yeah, a few insights

343
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,040
to create your dashboards here. Well, you have to create general dashboards and also

344
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,120
data-driven SEO dashboards in this case. And yeah, that's pretty obvious. And more functionalities.

345
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,480
Well, here, in this case, we have covered only a few functionalities of Matomo regarding

346
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,920
your SEO. And what's important to know is that you have no sampling in Matomo unless

347
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:22,480
you need it in very specific situations. But by default, you have all the data you need

348
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:29,760
to carry in your calculations. You also get your own data. It's your own data, which is

349
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,480
very, very important to me, so that you can get them, and keep them, and do whatever you

350
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,120
want with it. And you can also draw information from Universal

351
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,560
Analytics. You can get them from Universal Analytics into Matomo to get your historical

352
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:51,320
data. You won't get everything, but it's good to mention that you can do that. And the last

353
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,640
thing is that you can also use the log import feature. I will give a presentation in 15

354
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,640
minutes on this same channel. And it's also something that is interesting from an SEO

355
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:11,280
perspective. OK, so sorry. Thank you. Any question? After we are a bit late, but that's

356
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,400
OK. OK. Thank you very much, Thomas and Hedger

357
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,960
Ma. Can you hear me? Yes, yes, yes.

358
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,240
OK, great. I'm currently looking at the chat to see if there's any questions from the audience.

359
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:34,360
I wrote nine of them, so I'm just going to ask them to you quickly, even though on the

360
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:40,160
chat it's true that we already think about potential. And so I really would like to thank

361
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,360
what's more the Matomo community for playing the game and answering to the questions of

362
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:52,280
the different people. So the first question is, but you somehow answered it within the

363
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:59,080
conferences. Are you using metadata such as the word numbers per page by using custom

364
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:06,960
dimension to analyze SEO? So you already answered to it, so to say. But sorry for this question.

365
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,640
Do you do it for real with your client? OK, that's that's my question, because from what

366
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,080
we could see from the outside, it's like it means in terms of database, it means a new

367
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,760
call, every new page which is loaded. So let's imagine that we collect metadata, the number

368
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,520
of words on the page and so on and so on. We may have actually too much data collected

369
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,160
to Matomo that we were not collecting before, or even some additional scripts which are

370
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,640
running in the background and making the pages slow to load. I just like to know your position

371
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:56,040
about this. I can answer. I think it's my part. No, it's I think it's not a hard load

372
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:06,000
because the whole dimensional thing is tracked before. You set the track page view to Matomo.

373
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,080
So you can collect the data and send it with a stack to Matomo at one time. And I think,

374
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:23,600
for example, to get the main content words, it's a millisecond procedure which are taken.

375
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:30,280
But it maybe makes sense that when you use the tech manage, you can also switching this

376
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:39,120
and can say I only sent this tracker for partial size or partial size or for a side region

377
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:46,400
or something else when the load is too heavy. So you can decide to change in the trigger,

378
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:55,360
for example, only on Wednesday or something else. So you can reduce the, but it's important

379
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:04,480
that you measure this data to see you make zero tests because why it's important. In

380
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,440
many cases, it's my problem. I have so many feelings in my stomach and say, oh, no, that's

381
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,760
a bad side or that's a bad idea to make this. And with the data you measure with Matomo,

382
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,640
you can say, okay, we can test it. We change the title, we change the headlines, we replace

383
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:30,080
this part of site and so on. And for me, it's very, I lost the screaming frog, but it's

384
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:37,800
only a problem because Google can only measure these values for my site when the sites are

385
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:45,280
also with it. So when you say cross and say this page is very low, but it's no value site,

386
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:53,360
nobody with it decides, I think it's not a really bad, really, really great problem for

387
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,920
your site. When you have 5 million sites and you have only 2000, it's more important that

388
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,720
you get, for example, the web hotels for this with the sites to bring it up. Yeah. And not

389
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,360
for the thin content sites or structure sites, which you have on the site.

390
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:19,360
Okay. Perfect. Thank you, Romain. Sure. I still have eight questions left. Next question

391
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,360
is about, do you have any solutions when it comes to measure the number of backlinks pointing

392
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,480
to a specific domain in order to store this value within Matomo? So I get that you get

393
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,360
the sense of the question is that we can get the number of referrals, but when it comes

394
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,360
to backlinks, so to say, adding a link pointing to a website, those are collected by third

395
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:46,120
party services such as Google Search Console or SEMrush or whatever. And have you ever

396
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,640
heard of a solution or have you ever thought about the solution in order to store this

397
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:59,240
data within the database as a plugin or whatever? Yes. I also, another baby, I learned in 20

398
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:08,720
years of SEO that the best backlinks are backlinks with real users. So my tip on this is build

399
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:18,040
a segment with the entry page of which site you will see. And you can say entry page contains,

400
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:26,040
for example, the site or is the site and then go onto referrals and we'll see all this referral

401
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:35,400
information about which sites. The problem is that the Chrome browser, for example, didn't

402
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:43,120
give you the information for the detailed site, which the backlink is stored. So the

403
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,340
problem is that we can, many times we get only the domain name. That's the problem.

404
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,280
So I think Matomo and also Google Analytics or other tools has a problem that the browsers

405
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:04,160
are not sharing this information anymore in this detailed data. So I think the best alternatives

406
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:12,760
are majestic SEO, Aharef and so on. And you can combine the sites and see which sites

407
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:22,080
are visited and which backlinks are bringing you no visitors. Yeah, I totally agree. These

408
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:28,200
aren't dedicated tools for that purpose. And they have a lot of financial means and technical

409
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,680
means to gather that. So yeah, obviously, you have to use those external tools. I haven't

410
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:42,480
found anything yet that can match this. Okay, sorry. Just a silly, loud talk, but couldn't

411
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,040
we imagine a custom dimension at the referral level? I mean, the fact that so as the action

412
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,040
level or visit level, we would have it at the referral level on which we could send

413
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:58,480
different values, just the authority of the link, such as the trust level or that kind

414
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,360
of thing. Sounds actually interesting. That was just a silly thought, but I was thinking

415
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:12,160
that, okay, maybe, maybe, okay. Next question is about, in your presentation, you showed

416
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,320
it was possible to measure 500 error messages, which are several ones. And I wanted to know

417
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,680
if the way you measure it is by log import, or do you use another method? And if it's

418
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,240
another method, how do you do so? Because it seems like super complicated to implement

419
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:37,920
compared to measuring another front page. Yes, the easiest way is on a pepcheap world.

420
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,840
When you have a pepcheap web server, you can say the hearty access, you can say, for example,

421
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:52,320
error document 500, and you can give error site to the CMS. And on this CMS site, it

422
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:59,280
can play in heart email, and you can integrate the source, the tracking code into it. That's

423
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:06,440
the easiest way to measure the 500 sites. Wow, super clear. Thank you. Next question

424
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:14,000
is, is there any improvement you wish Matomo to have in order to analyze better SEO? So

425
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,280
you show us SEO Web Vitals, which is like the last plugin that the Matomo team developed.

426
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,000
But are there any room for improvement that you can see for SEO?

427
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,840
Well, yes, but maybe not directly into Matomo. What I wish could be done is that we can have

428
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:41,600
access, I mean, tools like SEMrush or Screaming Frog could get you an access to Matomo, so

429
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,200
that you can cross your Matomo instance data with SEMrush, just like you do with Google

430
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,960
Analytics right now, or with Screaming Frog, by the way. I've sent them a few tweets about

431
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,640
that. And yeah, they said they're interested, but yeah, I guess it takes time to develop

432
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,560
this kind of feature. And no worries, guys, by the way. And yeah, this is what I think

433
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:08,400
could be great, that we can get all the kind of access we had before with these kind of

434
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
tools. Yeah, directly into Matomo.

435
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:17,120
Okay, so it will be more like an API discussing with SEMrush, for example, just exporting

436
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,880
some configuration we made in SEMrush in order to get the less data for competitors or the

437
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,920
list of the backlinks, that kind of thing.

438
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,560
It goes in both directions. I mean, to get the first thing is that when you connect to

439
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:38,320
your SEMrush account and create a project that you can get, you can connect your SEMrush

440
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:44,160
project to your Matomo instance, so that your traffic data goes into SEMrush and you can

441
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,320
compare things. And also that you can get all as well data from SEMrush into Matomo.

442
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,200
But this is about developing plugins. And yeah, it takes time and money.

443
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,640
Okay. Next question is more linked to what you just said, Jean-Marc. Do you identify

444
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:08,640
potential bridges between bots such as Screaming Frog and Matomo in order to populate Matomo

445
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,720
with some data? I'm mostly thinking of the number of pages listed in Matomo might be

446
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,000
different for the number of pages that we really have on the website. And yeah, do you

447
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,520
identify possibility here? Maybe you can tell us a bit more about what you discussed with

448
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,520
Screaming Frog though.

449
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:35,160
Yeah. Okay. So in five minutes, I'm going to do the other section. But yeah, but I see

450
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:42,160
yes, about the Screaming Frog. Not too sure. Yeah, not too sure about that actually.

451
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,160
Yeah. No, no, no worries.

452
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:54,160
That's how good bots are. Matomo is actual is a bot tracking prevention. It's also there

453
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:00,680
you can spam reference and you have all those functions also plug in for the port tracker,

454
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:09,160
which only working. But if JavaScript is disabled, for example, many bots have no JavaScript,

455
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:18,760
but this bots which have JavaScript and very good implemented, you cannot see if it is

456
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,640
a bot or not. You can see it on your actions in the, in the, in the visitor log, for example,

457
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:34,560
that the bot is really plump calling every new file every second, for example, and you

458
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,960
can whistle segments, you can say, okay, this information, then.

459
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,360
Okay. Yes. Yeah. What I wanted to say, sorry, I was focusing on the other position just

460
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,880
before that. So I didn't say anyway. And yeah, that's a that's one part. But the other thing

461
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,480
you can do is again to import data from your logs, and you can get this information you

462
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,480
want.

463
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,480
Okay.

464
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,520
A quick one for Thomas is knowing Matomo is a key success factor when it comes to sell

465
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,520
SEO services in Germany.

466
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:15,320
Sorry, I understand it. Let's let's say that you are providing SEO services in Germany

467
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:22,360
is having some knowledge in terms of analyzing data with Matomo is a key success factor to

468
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:28,280
win a contract. Or do most of companies in Germany, they don't care. Either you use Matomo

469
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:35,040
or Google Analytics. And if you are not a Matomo expert, it doesn't really matter.

470
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:43,160
That's a difficult question, because we see that more and more shops, for example, switching

471
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:50,200
to Matomo I have in Germany, I have, for example, Siemens, VB, it's big, big brands, which are

472
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:58,200
switching to Matomo. And so also e commerce shops, and Red Bull is also moving to Matomo

473
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:07,360
and so on. And when you know Google Analytics, you find very easily some statistics in Matomo

474
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,360
also.

475
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:15,840
And I think for reporting, it's very interesting, because GR4 is standing out next year. And

476
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,960
we don't have a bounce rate, for example, in GRV at the moment, maybe they implemented,

477
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,360
but say they plan to organize all those events. But you have a bounce rate, you have to page

478
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:35,400
overview, what you see is every URL in Google Analytics and see how many side impressions

479
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:42,000
I have. And this is removing in Google Analytics fall. And so you have with Matomo alternatives

480
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:51,600
that you can see your old reports, which you can give it more. And I think it's, it's more

481
00:52:51,600 --> 00:53:00,440
and more agencies in Germany are setting up a Matomo and also work with this. In Germany,

482
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:09,120
it's also some good, some big seminar, one to one, but it's also from Alexander Hollis,

483
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:18,480
it's a very big training courses, which is also Google Analytics. And they set up with

484
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,400
me a Matomo solution for this.

485
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:32,120
Okay, guys, I have been pinged many times on the chat in order to close the discussion.

486
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:38,760
I really hope, first of all, thank you very much. Thank you very much for suggesting this

487
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:46,800
presentation to do it in duo. So the different nationalities coming together, sharing expertise,

488
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,120
that's really great. And also maybe next year, we could find you for the V2 of this conference

489
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:58,120
or maybe addressing the search engine dotizing part, because it's true that could be as well

490
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:04,000
subject to another big talk. We would like to thank you on small and all the best remark

491
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:13,000
for your next talk. Close the room now. All the best. I invite you to answer the remaining

492
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,920
questions on the chat. Have a great afternoon. Bye.

493
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,080
Thank you. Bye. See you. Good luck, Mark.
