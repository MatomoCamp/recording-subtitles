1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
Yeah, okay, so thank you again for this opportunity to talk about Matomo.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,520
I love Matomo.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,640
I love free software in general.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,880
And this talk is about hardening Matomo in terms of security.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,880
And this is not really oriented to super-experienced users.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,240
This is more oriented from curious persons and to beginners.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,600
But there are some things that can be discussed together with experienced people.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:47,840
And some I'm here from the Italian Linux Society that is an association in Italy, a volunteer

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,080
association talking about free software and open-source software.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,520
And in Italy, it's very interesting this period because everything, everywhere is talking

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,680
about Google Analytics and Matomo.

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,320
And I will talk later on the reasons.

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:12,120
And I'm also an ET consultant for Wikimedia Switzerland and a volunteer sysadmin for the

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,280
Italian chapter, the Wikimedia Italian chapter.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,200
And let's say something that I'm not an investor in Matomo.

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm not someone who trains users about Matomo.

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:34,960
I'm just a volunteer spreading Matomo everywhere because I like this tool, I like the problem

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:43,680
it fixes, and I like the ownership, and I like its free software and open-source software.

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,080
And so I'm here from Italy because some months ago, the Italian Data Protection Authority

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,040
said this interesting news that Google Analytics is now banned in the whole nation.

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,080
And this is really interesting because it really means what they say that it's not something

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,560
related only to public websites.

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:19,360
It's like public administrations, like schools, or et cetera, it's about also private websites.

24
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:28,400
And in fact, the whole story was about that even the EP address is considered an personal

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
data.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,000
And so if you have a website with Google Analytics and the user visits the website and you send

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,680
the EP of your visitors to Google Analytics because you have embedded this tool, it's

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,680
not a very good idea because Google is capable of enriching this data and connect the EP

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,280
to their logged-in user.

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,640
And so this is really a violation of the GDPR in Italy and also in other nations.

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:09,120
And I'm telling this because it's also something related to security because you know that

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,520
in the United States, the intelligence agencies and the government, if they want to investigate

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,760
on a user, they can access the data.

34
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,880
And if you are an European visitor and if you don't live in the United States, it does

35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
not matter.

36
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,400
So this is why there are not enough safeguards at the moment.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,320
And so a lot of people in Italy is talking about Google Analytics.

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,720
This is just to talk about something I have seen with my eyes in the last months.

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,360
Yeah, good job, Google Analytics.

40
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,760
And so let's talk about security.

41
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:07,180
There are two ways, one moment, in this period, everyone in Italy is avoiding to embed anything.

42
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,040
So they are also closing YouTube videos and they are adopting a lot of open source and

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,760
they are also migrating to LibreJS.

44
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,720
I don't know if you know the LibreJS project, but it's something that says that every single

45
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,160
JavaScript alliance on your website should be open and Libre software.

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:36,120
And so I'm not saying that everybody in the world should adopt the LibreJS, but I'm saying

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:45,120
that this is the moment to talk about this opportunity because it's very hot this period.

48
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,340
So OK, we like Matomo.

49
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,240
We deploy Matomo on our servers.

50
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
We deploy Matomo on our Raspberry PIs.

51
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:04,240
We deploy Matomo using Docker, using cheap hosting services, using, I don't know, we

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,960
host Matomo in a lot of ways.

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,760
And it's very hard for some people, also for beginners, but also for intermediate people

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,580
to understand that there are only two ways to make a system safe.

55
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,440
And the first way is the Kirchhoff principle that is really, really, really OK for open

56
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,320
source software because if you have an open source software, you have to think about it.

57
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,680
Everyone in the world knows how your system is designed and you have to keep your password

58
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,280
secret and only the password is the stuff that you can have to keep secret.

59
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,040
And so the other principle is have everything simple and stupid because if you don't understand

60
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:01,520
how you are applying security measures to your system, you will never be able to have

61
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,880
a well-designed environment and a safe environment.

62
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:13,040
So I just suggest these two principles, the Kirchhoff and the KISS principles.

63
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:22,600
Let's start saying that the easiest way to keep a system safe is to apply a lot of mitigation,

64
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,760
a lot of mitigation to reduce the attack surface.

65
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,280
Because when you have a big environment like a media wiki, like a WordPress, like a Matomo,

66
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,120
there are a lot of lines of source code that you have to trust.

67
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,280
And I'm not saying that I don't trust Matomo, I'm just saying that it's a very big project

68
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,840
and that shit happens.

69
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,280
And so maybe a contributor has done something wrong in the very early phases.

70
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,300
Maybe what I mean is that there are a lot of possibilities that one line in this number

71
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,240
of PHP lines or one line in this number of JavaScript lines, that there are a lot of

72
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,700
lines of source code, maybe there is a vulnerability.

73
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:16,720
And so it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when this problem will be discovered.

74
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,880
And this is not related to Matomo, this is related to whatever project we can design

75
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
in our life.

76
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,720
An interesting part of Matomo is that the plugin directory involves maybe the majority

77
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:40,160
of the line of codes, maybe because Matomo is very well decentralized in terms of its

78
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
design.

79
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,760
So each component has its own plugin.

80
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,120
And I really like this fact.

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,560
And so the first thing that we can suggest to reduce the attack surface of your Matomo

82
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,880
is just a reply to this question.

83
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,800
So how many plugins have you in your installation?

84
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,440
And if you have your Matomo, you know that you can go to the system menu and to the plugins

85
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:16,120
and see the active plugins that maybe, this is not a recent screenshot, this is my platform

86
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:23,800
some days ago, but I think that there are a lot of plugins that maybe you are not using

87
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,400
it just from the screenshot.

88
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Maybe, I don't know if I can highlight the DBStats plugin that allows to do reports for

89
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,100
super users.

90
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,720
So it's not something delivered to users, it's something for super users.

91
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,680
A lot of people, honestly, I don't use this plugin.

92
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,320
So I am not saying to disable this plugin, to disable a plugin, by the way, you can click

93
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,320
on the link on the left and to activate the other link.

94
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:02,160
But I'm saying, if you are not using the e-commerce plugin, the example API plugin, if you are,

95
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,400
because maybe you have just a blog, maybe you don't need this to see examples.

96
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,520
Every plugin you disable, you are reducing the surface attack of your platform.

97
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,960
And this is really, really good because whenever you want, you can enable these plugins again.

98
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,640
So it's not a problem of destroying your platform.

99
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
You can, whenever you want, enable it again.

100
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,280
And so also the marketplace, the marketplace is maybe a very big plugin and we have connections

101
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
to the web.

102
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:41,120
And so there are a lot of code that needs sanitization, that needs filters, et cetera.

103
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,360
And so I suggest when you install something from the marketplace, to disable the marketplace,

104
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
why not?

105
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,480
Also, maybe not all the people have an SMS gateway on their Matomo.

106
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,800
So I just suggest to disable the SMS gateway.

107
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,960
So I think this is just an overview of something that you can do.

108
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,400
This is a list of a lot of plugins that I have not in production and I may recommend

109
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,560
to verify that you use them as well.

110
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,520
And also, let's talk about maybe the two-factor authentication.

111
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,560
The two-factor authentication is really, I really like the way it was implemented.

112
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,800
And I recommend enabling it if you need it, but if you are not using it, feel free to

113
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,480
disable it because, by the way, you can always enable it in the future.

114
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:48,960
But it's not strange to listen to someone saying that the two-factor authentication

115
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,800
may be disabled in this kind of talk.

116
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:04,160
I mean, sometimes it's not a very, very, very good idea to enforce this kind of tools.

117
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:12,480
Using tools like multi-factor authentication in whatever tool may be counterproductive,

118
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,600
maybe problematic because maybe not all your users are trained to handle the two-factor

119
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,920
authentication side effects.

120
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,960
For example, they need to have a mobile phone and their mobile phone, they have an application

121
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,040
and their application must not be malware.

122
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:42,160
And so there are a lot of components that a two-factor authentication can worsen, a

123
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,560
lot of facts that can be not improved, can not improve.

124
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,880
And so, for example, what about a lot of social media managers that don't know anything about

125
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,760
advanced security measures?

126
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:03,480
And so maybe they just need to have very strong password and without risking to expose their

127
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,680
mobile phone to additional vulnerabilities.

128
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,120
So do your evaluations.

129
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,240
Maybe don't try to enforce the tool to every user in the world.

130
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:24,640
Just try to have rigid password politics, very strong password, et cetera, and, again,

131
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
do your evaluations.

132
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:33,560
By the way, if you want to try the best, I think that for me it's the best, the best

133
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:41,200
one-time password application that I use with my Matome installation, I think I have a very

134
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,000
old Matome installation, but I think that it still works.

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Just contact me if it's not.

136
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,160
The free OTP is an application from FDroid.

137
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,280
You know, FDroid, it's a repository for Android smartphone that only contains free software,

138
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,640
and it's very, very, very verified.

139
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,440
It's open source, and this application is easy to use, and so I recommend this software.

140
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:14,040
And if you have a lot of users and if you're enforcing them to use free OTP, I recommend

141
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:23,400
in doing it only if they have an Android and if they have not customized a lot the phone,

142
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:31,640
if they have maybe disabled the Play Store or this kind of stuff.

143
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,720
So a lot of people ask, what if my Matome is compromised?

144
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
This is not a good question.

145
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,960
This is a very terrible question, but I can think a very simple way you can mitigate the

146
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:54,400
risk after your Matome was compromised is to enable this option to anonymize as much

147
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:02,240
as possible all the IP addresses of your users, because when you activate this option, you

148
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,600
know that Matome does not save this information in the database, and this is awesome.

149
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,240
Matome does not save this information, and so if your database is hacked, it does not

150
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,800
contain this information, and there is less data to be disclosed to the entire universe.

151
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,080
So this may seem stupid, but this is not stupid.

152
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:38,080
So we are here to understand when we are downloading Matome on our server, we want to understand

153
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:46,160
what should be exposed, what should be maybe writeable, what should be maybe hidden, and

154
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:55,520
so I recommend in don't trusting this talk, but just reading the amazing official documentation

155
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
of Matome.

156
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:04,400
I think that one hour in reading the Matome documentation can save your company, so please

157
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,040
read the documentation.

158
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:14,920
But well, in short, we know that when we download Matome, whatever version, we know to understand

159
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:25,040
each file, what should be its user, what should be its permissions, who should see this file,

160
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,840
who should execute this file.

161
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,400
This is a very important question for a system administrator.

162
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,160
But before talking about permissions, we need to understand how we are using Matome.

163
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:48,640
A lot of people are adopting Matome through this method, the PHP FPM method, and a lot

164
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:57,160
of people without knowing about it is adopting Matome with this component, the mode PHP mode.

165
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,480
So we have two methods, we have two very different methods to adopt Matome.

166
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:12,480
We have also Docker machines, obviously, but these are probably the most adopted situations.

167
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,400
I have done an interview about it, a survey, and they are very widely known.

168
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:27,320
A word about the PHP FPM method, how to understand that you are using this method.

169
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:34,600
You can see that you are using this method if when you do one request to your web server,

170
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,120
these ports that are not Matome, but something else, and your Matome is under another web

171
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,040
server running on your machine, but on a different port.

172
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,200
Probably if you have this situation, you are under the PHP FPM configuration.

173
00:16:51,200 --> 00:17:01,040
Instead, if you have just a web server and nothing else, probably you are under this

174
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,680
configuration, the mode PHP.

175
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:13,620
The mode PHP version is an interesting and historically very, very widely adopted configuration

176
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,360
because it's very, very simple to install on your Linux server.

177
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:26,100
You just run IPT install, Apache, PHP, and everything works.

178
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:34,840
So we have a very big process under your Unix machine, under your Linux.

179
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Usually the Unix user is www.data.

180
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:48,280
This is the name of the Unix user because you know that in Linux, every system has its

181
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,360
own user dedicated to the system.

182
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,000
So you have a web server daemon with its user, you have a mail server daemon with its user,

183
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,480
and this is how it works.

184
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:07,800
You have one Unix user running the whole web server, listening on a port, maybe this port

185
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,240
or maybe the HTTP port, I don't know, but there is a very big process handling whatever

186
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,600
website you have in your single server.

187
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:25,000
So maybe you have one, two, three applications, two domains, server by the same server, and

188
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,600
only one Unix user handling every request.

189
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:39,160
And this is not optimal for most situations because if you have an application, then Matomo,

190
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:49,040
WordPress, over the same process, over the same Unix user, what if maybe this application

191
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,080
is compromised?

192
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:59,160
This is problematic because maybe this problematic application can go in the parent directory

193
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:06,520
and go up and inspect all the applications and so can expand and write other stuff in

194
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,680
other places.

195
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,840
And so it's not usually a good idea.

196
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:19,360
There are a lot of very cheap hosting services offering this as default, and users usually

197
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
don't know about it.

198
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,680
A lot of users adopting this system do this together with this directive.

199
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
What is this?

200
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,000
They open-paste this directive.

201
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:46,600
If you have PHP running on a domain server, you can say, okay, if you visit example.org,

202
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,120
you can only visit this place.

203
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,560
If you visit example.net, you can only visit this place.

204
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,480
And the process cannot go in the other places.

205
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:11,240
And this is possible thanks to this directive that can be set in PHP on each virtual host.

206
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,480
But the problem is that this directive is that if you use it, for example, if you declare,

207
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:27,480
okay, I declare open-based here is bar, home, Matomo, a place on your system, then you have

208
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,840
another web server, another virtual host, and you say another value.

209
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,800
So you can set a different value for each virtual host to try to isolate the process.

210
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,680
The problem is that PHP is isolating the process.

211
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,400
And in fact, this is an Apache configuration.

212
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,900
This is a very frequent configuration.

213
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:59,360
So you have a server name, and so all the people from this domain go to this place.

214
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,480
And then you say, you declare this directive to isolate the process, and so you know that

215
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,080
you cannot go out of this place.

216
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,840
And this is not really, really safe, because if you read the documentation, it's very,

217
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,360
very clear that open-based here, it's not a security measure.

218
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
It's an extra safety.

219
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:29,320
I don't know what an extra safety is, but the universe is adopting this as a security

220
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,400
measure, and they should stop.

221
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,520
So if you see a configuration like that, stop adopting this, because it's not really safe.

222
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,560
And so let's talk about the PHP, the FPM method.

223
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:54,480
This is a very, very frequent alternative to the mod PHP, so this is the old configuration.

224
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,920
This is the new configuration.

225
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:05,640
I invented to have isolated processes that work alongside a front-end web server.

226
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,360
So you really have a front-end web server serving maybe static files, and then you have

227
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:22,400
an underlying web server serving dynamic files with its own Unix user, and so it can be isolated,

228
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,200
and it runs on its dedicated port.

229
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,640
So it's completely separated.

230
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,600
Now, you can say, okay, I have a Docker.

231
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,640
My configuration is different, but it's not so different, because if you have Docker,

232
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:46,720
so with Docker, you have a front-end web server that usually is Nginx or Apache.

233
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,120
And then you have your Docker running on the random port, but what I'm saying is that usually

234
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,480
Docker is not in this position.

235
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:06,000
Usually Docker is not exposed to handle every request for HTTPS and every request for HTTP.

236
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:15,520
So you have a front-end web server also because it simplifies let's encrypt renewal, I don't

237
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:24,400
know, or it allows you to have a lot of websites in your server and mix it by the Apache web

238
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,560
server.

239
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:34,320
What I'm saying is that this is a very frequent situation, and how to secure this situation.

240
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,200
Let's talk about how it works.

241
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,540
So you have a front-end web server.

242
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,600
You do a request, and your front-end web server handles it.

243
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
What is your front-end web server?

244
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We saved it.

245
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,920
It's Apache or Nginx.

246
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,120
It doesn't matter.

247
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
One or the other.

248
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,760
That's not better in this discourse.

249
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:05,120
What I'm saying, if you visit example.org, maybe example.org, your request goes directly

250
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,260
to the correct PHP, FPM web server.

251
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:18,800
Maybe if you want, so if you want Amatomo, you visit this back-end web server and the

252
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:25,040
reply goes to the user, and if you want your blog, maybe you have a blog, your request

253
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,320
goes to the other web server.

254
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:38,480
So every site has its dedicated port, and the user usually doesn't connect directly

255
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,480
to this port.

256
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,320
This is the situation.

257
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:52,480
Every application, of course, has its dedicated file system path name, and the interesting

258
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:02,120
part is that we are not in a situation where we have a big user with access to all these

259
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:09,880
file systems, but instead we have a dedicated user with access to that specific file system

260
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
place.

261
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,480
So we have another user with access to the other file system place, et cetera, et cetera.

262
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,400
And this allows a lot of isolation.

263
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,760
If you know how to do it.

264
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:31,740
And that's also, you still have a Unix user, and you still need to know that the user probably

265
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,560
needed to access this file system, but just for static files, for example, and then you

266
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:46,340
have another Unix user that must have access to this file system for the dynamic files.

267
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:54,960
So PHP files are executed by this user, and static file are provided by the www data user.

268
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,000
So this is how it works.

269
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,280
And this is a basic example on how to implement everything on your web server.

270
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:08,360
Maybe you have the front-end web server Apache configured in this way to say that there is

271
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,120
a document root somewhere.

272
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:19,320
And then I have not put it there, but you can imagine that in the next slides, we have

273
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:26,240
the proxy, proxying all the requests on the underlying web server.

274
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:34,960
And this is the most important part of our talk, how to have a PHP FPM safe, secure,

275
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
and hardened.

276
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,960
First of all, you have to create a dedicated user for your purpose, and be sure that only

277
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,760
that user can access critical places in that file system of your application.

278
00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:00,000
So you can declare a PHP directive to say that the uploaded files must be in place,

279
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,760
and that only this user can be assigned to this place to access the temporary resources,

280
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,200
or I don't know.

281
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:18,760
But if you additionally want to set other strange directive to harden even more, why

282
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
not?

283
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,760
This is a good strategy to use open base there in a right way.

284
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:33,600
So using to give something more, so to have everything under a cage, an additional cage,

285
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,960
but this is not the only cage of your system.

286
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,280
This is the cage of your system, a dedicated user, and a dedicated file system path name

287
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,540
with correct permissions.

288
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:54,720
So for example, on your file system, you have your Matomo installed in this position, deployed

289
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,760
in this position, and you have the temporary directive that is this one.

290
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:10,200
And its permissions are its user, it's the one in your FPM web server, and its group,

291
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:19,400
it's the one assigned to the same process, and look about this permission field.

292
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:27,280
If you know how to read this field, it means that let's clear everything.

293
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:35,080
What I'm highlighting here is that this Apache Matomo is the user who can read, write, and

294
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,240
execute this in this file.

295
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,040
So execute in a directory context means that you can access this file.

296
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:50,520
And the user group as well can do the same things, but all the others cannot.

297
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,840
So you have hardened your installation, removing privileges on critical path names.

298
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,720
This is very, very important.

299
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:09,640
And so again, use your configuration to dedicate a user and have a path name and declare your

300
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:17,960
configurations in order to instruct the process to use your custom path names instead of just

301
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,480
TMP, that it's global.

302
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,400
And so this is simple but effective.

303
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:38,240
So if you are curious about how to put everything in a very, very robust cage, I suggest to

304
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,320
just assign everything to the root user and to the root group.

305
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,920
This is not scaring.

306
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,360
Sometimes we hear, oh my god, the root user should not execute this file.

307
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
Don't be confused.

308
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:05,640
If a file is owned by the root user, it means that only the root user can read, write, and

309
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
execute.

310
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,960
So if this file is owned by the root group, so you know the user group, it means that

311
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,680
only the group can read this file.

312
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:25,680
And all the others, well, all the others for this markdown file can read this file.

313
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Why not?

314
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,480
But cannot write in any way.

315
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:36,200
Also an interesting part, take for example, the Matomo.js, the Matomo.js file needs write

316
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,260
access.

317
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,800
So you can assign it to the dedicated user and to the dedicated group and saying that

318
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:52,560
the dedicated user can read and write, but every other user in your system cannot touch

319
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,080
that file.

320
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
And this is very important.

321
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,200
This file is not secret.

322
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,120
There is no need to remove the read access, the last read access.

323
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:12,960
So it's evaluate, always evaluate the last column that it's the most important one declaring

324
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,680
what other users in your system can do with this file.

325
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:26,400
And so for example, I have removed the, you see that the temporary directive has nothing

326
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,080
in the, I have not highlighted it correctly, but has nothing in the last permissions.

327
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:39,520
So the temp directory can only be wrote by the Apache user and to the Apache group.

328
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:47,320
So this is what I'm saying, evaluate your application, understand what need read access.

329
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,420
So probably everything need read access, you know, what need write access.

330
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,360
So for this file, you assign the dedicated user.

331
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,680
What needed to be hided to everybody but your users.

332
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:12,080
And so you do the same, but without the other field, without allowing other users to read,

333
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,960
write, and execute.

334
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Okay.

335
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,440
I don't know what I'm showing here.

336
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
Okay.

337
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,960
What I want to say is that this is not easy.

338
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
This is not easy.

339
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,500
You have to read the documentation, you have to understand that the config directory may

340
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:45,600
be public, but the files inside the config directory have to be private.

341
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,320
So inspect your application, read the official documentation, be, use the change modality

342
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,560
for the files and use the change owner for the files wisely.

343
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,200
So this is really how your application can be hardened in a great way.

344
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:13,440
Because the nice part about having some files on it by root is that it's like whatever other

345
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,400
service in your Linux system is designed, try to access other parts of your system.

346
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,120
If any other process, for example, if you install, I don't know, I really don't know,

347
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,320
Apache, for example, Apache, every file, the system file of Apache is owned by root.

348
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,280
And only the system, the super administrator can edit this file.

349
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,400
And this is the same for your Matomo installation.

350
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:49,560
So you should have a script to harden your installation when you want is freezed.

351
00:33:49,560 --> 00:34:01,160
So you want is like in a not upgradable state and a script allowing to put everything under

352
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,440
the user of your web server to be able to upgrade your system.

353
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:15,100
So you should have two configurations, two scripts and one for everyday usage for production.

354
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,280
So you run the script and set your permissions in this way.

355
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,920
And another script that put your permissions like in whatever cheap hosting environment.

356
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,720
And so with every file assigned to the web server users.

357
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:38,240
But this is problematic because having every file under the same user means that if there

358
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,920
is a security issue in your application, this user can write in every file of your environment.

359
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,160
And this is not the desired situation.

360
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:59,040
So it can be a stupid, but trust me, if take care about your applications, Matomo included,

361
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:12,760
WordPress included, and if you want to have everything in a good state, I recommend having

362
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:21,440
a kind of hardened production configuration and upgrade the configuration.

363
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:33,040
So I'm ready for talking about other stuff, but I just recommend subscribing to CVE newsletters

364
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:41,400
because it's very important to be the first in the universe when something really bad

365
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,760
happens in the code base.

366
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,400
Maybe there is a problem affecting people without authentication and it does not require

367
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,560
many complexity to trigger the issue.

368
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,240
So I recommend to subscribe to CVE newsletters.

369
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:09,320
I say this because a lot of people don't do this and this is definitely a problem.

370
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:16,200
Another stupid tip is keep your platform up to date, but if you have the possibility,

371
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:24,280
use the LTS version of Matomo so you have not to update your software for whatever new

372
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,680
feature is introduced.

373
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:32,280
Maybe because you don't have time to test everything, but you want an environment in

374
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,360
a safe state where only security patches are applied regularly.

375
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,680
And please keep your users trained.

376
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,320
So it's not important to enforce two-factor authentication on your whole organic base

377
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:56,000
because if you don't know how to use it, you will just make bigger mistakes.

378
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,960
So train your users.

379
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:08,480
And please keep your devices without malware because the majority of the vulnerabilities

380
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,080
nowadays don't come from Matomo itself.

381
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,280
The majority of vulnerabilities come from you.

382
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,640
So you are you, the person who has maybe security issues on your mobile phone or security issues

383
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,600
on your Wi-Fi area, security issues on your laptop.

384
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:33,520
Maybe you installed a video game from a random website and now your computer is totally compromised.

385
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,520
So I'm not saying that it's really, really huge, useful to have a very, very hard-ended

386
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:53,040
installation if the administrators have not devices with a controlled state.

387
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,760
So try to use as much as possible open-source software.

388
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:06,200
If you have Android user systems, buy an Android dedicated for work, remove the Play Store,

389
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,760
remove everything, install Android, remove whatever proprietary app.

390
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,480
And then you can be safe to use stuff like the OTP applications.

391
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,360
And so use as much possible free software.

392
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:33,520
I really have to say, please don't think that you will be not owned because this is the

393
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,600
most problematic assumption.

394
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:43,400
So please assume that you will be owned in the future and invest in reading documentation.

395
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,960
Invest in exploring your tool.

396
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:57,240
Invest in trying to hack your system, try to use not-privileged users.

397
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:06,640
Try to create another Unix user on your system with low privileges and then try to do a privilege

398
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,760
escalation trying to inspect your web servers and your applications.

399
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:23,640
So these are just bad words to remember to try to be the one that can enter in your system

400
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:30,680
before someone else do this for you.

401
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,240
This is not good.

402
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
So thank you so much.

00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,400
So saying that this presentation is by Valerio.

410
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,560
Thank you so much for everything.

411
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:06,000
Can I thank again the Matomo organizers because MatomoCamp is realized with 100% open-source

412
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
software and deeper software.

413
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,400
And this is really amazing because, again, Matomo is open-source, MatomoCamp is open-source,

414
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,360
and this is really a really, really, really good way to engage technical communities that

415
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,120
care about the privacy and care about software freedom.

416
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,920
So thank you again.

417
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:34,440
Whatever question can be delivered to the Matrix chat, and I hope that we had a good

418
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
time together.

419
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,400
Valerio, thank you very much for your insightful talk.

420
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,160
And you highlighted a lot of important things to consider.

421
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,400
And this is also one of my favorite topics because it is mostly treated very poorly.

422
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,360
And even it is a topic which is neglected in many companies.

423
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,320
And also, you compressed the topic very well.

424
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,960
You talked about many, many details.

425
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,480
And also, there is so much more, but I think you mentioned very important things.

426
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,000
Perhaps we have some questions here that, if not right now, there are some questions

427
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,760
from my side also because you are a security expert.

428
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,040
So perhaps you can recommend the audience something like, is there something like automated

429
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
security audits?

430
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:39,120
Is there a software for that to check the software automatically for CVEs or something

431
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
like that?

432
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
Okay.

433
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:49,400
Honestly, I know the part related to WordPress more than the part related to Matomo.

434
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,880
There are a lot of tools.

435
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,040
I think you can search and there are a lot of tools.

436
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:03,480
I actually cannot recommend any of them because I recommend in being proactive and keeping

437
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,880
the platform up to date as soon as possible and without receiving any of these emails

438
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,320
or notifications.

439
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,200
And this is probably the best way to keep your system up to date.

440
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:23,040
Because usually, normal users, when they receive this kind of notification, it's too late because

441
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:31,120
maybe you are in Italy or you are from, I don't know, and we are decentralized against

442
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:37,320
the Matomo developers who can quickly handle the situation and release a security patch

443
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,880
and offer you an update quickly on your platform.

444
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,240
So I recommend you just update your platform and please feel free to share some automated

445
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,360
tools to inspect maybe not updated platform and this kind of stuff.

446
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,920
Thank you for the question.

447
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,840
I'm very curious and thank you for sharing to me if somebody knows.

448
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Of course.

449
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,680
And as a quick comment on that, it's also for the audience a very important thing.

450
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:15,840
As soon as an update is out, we mark it if it has a security concern, we mark it with

451
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,200
a minor, major or critical attack.

452
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,800
So you know how important it is to make this update.

453
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
That's wonderful.

454
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,360
And are there more questions?

455
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Because I'm really curious.

456
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Do we have other questions right now?

457
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Okay.

458
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:48,520
If not right now, then the chat will stay open and perhaps Valerio has some minutes

459
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,560
left to answer more questions if there are any.

460
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,760
But thank you very much for that very, very important topic.

461
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,480
And also this talk will be online as a video on the video platform.

462
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,880
And yeah, Valerio, thank you again a lot and greetings to Italy.

463
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,920
Thank you so much.

464
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,640
And again, go Matomo, go, thank you for doing that.

465
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Thank you.

466
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Goodbye.

467
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Bye bye.

468
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Ciao, pane pizza Matomo.

469
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:40,840
Ciao.
