00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,040
Hi, everyone. Glad to be here to talk about the topic for today, which is imagine an ideal

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:32,680
Matomo. So just before I start, I just want to say a few words about the context of this

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:43,360
presentation. Typically here, what I'm going to be talking about is providing a better experience

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:51,840
to marketing people, non-technical people, because a lot of what I'm going to be talking about can

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:03,280
be addressed using what I call some more technical strategies or resources. This is just my few ideas

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,960
and I really like that at the end of the presentation you can share your ideas also so we can build some

7
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,600
kind of list of our expectations regarding the tool in the future. So what we're going to be talking

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:29,760
about is Matomo itself, the Tag Manager, DataVis tool and Consent Management Platform. So let's dive

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,160
in directly. First of all, when we're talking about Matomo, there is something really annoying

10
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:44,680
that I have encountered many times is when you have a lot of websites and you want to find a

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:52,360
specific one. In this situation, you have to use the site's search field, but this site's search

12
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,800
field is located at the bottom of the page. So in my dreams, I would like to have the search site

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:08,920
panel right above so you can just type the name of the website and it's going to be right in front

14
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:19,280
of your house. This is the first thing, place search fields above. The second one is a bit more

15
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,680
annoying, I think, because when you're doing web analytics, you're talking about digital performance

16
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:35,520
and you're talking about metrics. And in some cases, those metrics are talking about specific

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:44,080
segments of audience. And unfortunately, for the moment, when you build your dashboard, you are

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:55,440
forced to segment your whole dashboard. You cannot segment just a metric within your dashboard. And

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,920
here, again, is some kind of footage that I made with my metric and the ability to have here the

20
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:13,520
segment directly based on this particular metric. Because otherwise, what we have to do is to take

21
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:21,640
the data out of Matomo and bring it to an external data visualization tool. It can be done, but for

22
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:29,800
some users, for some teams, I have encountered the situation where they just want to remain within

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:39,120
Matomo and not go outside of it. So this one is, I think, a really interesting one, because the

24
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:49,000
whole idea behind presentation is to have some kind of complete web analytics suite. And this

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,240
feature, I think, is quite valuable. Another example of stuff that are annoying in the

26
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:09,640
projects is the situation where you want to follow users cross-domain. So for instance, you have a

27
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:17,640
client who says, OK, I have three, four, five websites, and I want to see what people do on

28
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,080
these different websites. Is there some cross user journey through these websites? And for that,

29
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:32,960
you create a Matomo site ID, and you configure it so that the journeys are captured through the

30
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,600
different domains. But unfortunately, in this situation, and this is the example that I display

31
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:49,920
here, you just have in the report page URL. In fact, you just have the URI. I think you don't

32
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,280
have the domain, and it's quite annoying because you don't know what you're talking about. So this

33
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,760
is the reason why I just added here in my dreams what it would look like. So for instance, here,

34
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:11,240
mysitea.com, slash FRFR, mysiteb.com, slash, et cetera, et cetera. Again, you can do some work

35
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,640
around with the Tag Manager, for instance. But again, the idea of the presentation is I am not

36
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:26,880
a technical person, and I encounter this situation that made me unhappy and thinking that Matomo is

37
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:41,720
not that interesting as a tool. Situation number three is when you look at the events reports,

38
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:50,040
most of the time you have people that are used to using Google Analytics reports. And it's quite

39
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:57,200
surprising for them not to see the whole variables, the whole event variables. So you have event

40
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,680
category, event action, but where is my event action? And again, the way I present it here is

41
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,920
when you want to separate the variables, but by default it's not presented that way. So it's,

42
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,960
again, more annoying for most people. So the idea here is that we could have event category,

43
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:31,760
event action, event names, and of course, event value. So I don't think it's a big deal, but yes,

44
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,480
you have to navigate through the different event variables, and that can be a bit disappointing.

45
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,600
In the same logic, when we're navigating through the different event variables,

46
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,280
and you're using, for instance, a search field. So here, for instance, I typed conversion here,

47
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,360
and I am on the event category level. I have my conversion, so it's filtered the way I want it.

48
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:09,920
But if I want to go down to the event action level, then my conversion, what I had typed here,

49
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:19,880
is lost. So again, it would be great if I could keep what I have typed here in the browser,

50
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:29,200
and also if the search filter could be located right above here, because if you have hundreds

51
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,320
of lines, then you have to scroll down all the way, and it's not hiding.

52
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:43,960
Another really annoying situation when I'm talking with my clients is why is that not

53
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:52,080
possible to combine more than three dimensions in custom reports? What do I do when I want to

54
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,560
have event category, event action, event name, and another custom dimension? And again,

55
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:08,240
for just regular marketing people, it's some kind of situation where they want to reject the tool,

56
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,520
because they think that it's not normal that you cannot, by default, and simply combine more than

57
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:24,720
three dimension. And again, they always make the comparison with Google Analytics. And since now,

58
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,160
it's obvious that we will have a lot of people migrating from GA to Matomo. I think that we

59
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:46,560
should address this specific topic. In the same field, talking about the custom reports,

60
00:08:46,560 --> 00:09:00,400
I was a bit surprised to see that not all metrics are available in the custom reports. So for

61
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,680
instance, I had clients wanting the average time on page in a custom report, and I discovered that

62
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:17,880
this metric is not available on the custom reports. So I think that at least there should be somewhere

63
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:29,080
where it is explained that this metric or this dimension will not be available by default so that

64
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,200
people can be prepared so that we can explain. And it's really disappointing because you have

65
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,480
something in mind, you're quite sure of what you're going to be doing, and you discover that

66
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:49,240
unfortunately, it's not possible. So what I suggest is that all metrics available in Matomo

67
00:09:49,240 --> 00:10:03,480
should be available in custom reports. Another situation, and it's regarding the moments where

68
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,840
you have dozens of websites to configure. And the example that I have in mind is the custom

69
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:25,120
dimension. Yes, if you have maybe 20, 30 custom dimensions to configure for 20, 30 websites,

70
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,080
it can take a lot of time. And if you do that manually, then you can make mistakes. So I again

71
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:43,840
assume that it can be done using maybe different APIs or technical stuff. But for regular marketing

72
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:52,200
people, I think it could be a good thing to have some kind of copy configuration button in the

73
00:10:52,200 --> 00:11:01,000
admin section. And in my mind, then you can decide that yes, I want to copy a custom dimensions.

74
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,800
For the customers also, you can decide that you want to duplicate them. For the segments,

75
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:19,360
it's a bit different because when you create them, you can decide that it's for one website

76
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,000
or all of them. But yes, the idea here is to not lose time in the configuration. And I'm reading

77
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,760
in the conversation, Thomas. Yes, regarding the other side, I've made a change request. Yes,

78
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:46,320
I think that obviously we should be a lot more indeed to ask these kind of changes. Because if

79
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:57,480
we are allowed to ask that, then it be prioritized, of course. Thank you, Thomas, for coming. Another

80
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:08,720
thing is about API testing. And again, this is in my ideal world, because I know that it's something

81
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:18,400
that may take a lot of time, resource tests and so on. But if we want to have a complete analytics

82
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:26,480
suite, then I think that we should have a with you. We get each other for any tests. That's what

83
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:35,720
Google did with the feature that was in the beginning in GA for the test. And then they

84
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:45,560
launched optimize. So again, you can use the testing feature in that is, I think, quite well

85
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,560
made when we are talking about building the tests. But when it's about, again, you are someone with

86
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:04,040
not a lot of resources and not able to build pages and have to ask for developers to build

87
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,360
pages to run your tests, it's a bit disappointing. And it would be a great advantage if we could have

88
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,720
everything in a box. And the editor, I think, is also something that might be really valuable for

89
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:35,240
the two as a global analytics suite. Something again, quite annoying is about the unique visitor

90
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:45,480
metric. It appears that by default, this metric is not available for custom periods in the reports.

91
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:56,920
It is documented. But you have to have a look in the documentation. Because what happens is that,

92
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:05,880
for instance, here I have this metric in a Google Data Studio. And at the first site, I'm thinking,

93
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,600
oh, something went wrong with my dashboard. Something is not working. And in fact, it's just

94
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:20,760
that unique visitors is not activated for custom dates and custom periods. So again, you have to

95
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:31,800
ask the people that handle the Matomo instance to make a change in some kind of technical file.

96
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:40,040
And then it's activated. And apparently, it's not activated by default because it costs a lot in

97
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,600
terms of resources on the servers. I'm not quite aware of that because, again, I'm not a technical

98
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,680
person. But this is something not acceptable for most people, for most marketing people. The unique

99
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,680
visitor metric is some kind of basic metric. And when you encounter the situation firstly,

100
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,680
and you explain to the customer that, oh, yes, in fact, the metric is not available by default,

101
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,720
they just don't get it. They just don't understand why can it be, how can it be possible that this

102
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:18,120
simple standard metric is not by default available on that tool. And this is the situation I

103
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,760
encountered a lot where people rejected it because they thought that, no, this is not possible. It's

104
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:32,120
not acceptable that this simple metric we cannot access simply. And we have to ask our IT department

105
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:40,120
to do some kind of stuff, or we have to ask the Matomo team to do something on the server so that

106
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:51,000
we can have a metric. So it's just a proposition. Yes, yes, yes, of course. Yes, in the config level,

107
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:03,240
but IMEI.php, clearly, it's something that can be done. But this is annoying when you have, let's

108
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:12,280
say, organizations where you have thousands, no, hundreds of people using a tool named Google

109
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,120
Analytics, and they migrate, and they are quite forced to migrate to another tool. And

110
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,520
they discover that this metric, this simple thing, you have to ask your IT department to do something

111
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:36,040
to access it. And yes, I think that there should be a simple button somewhere in the UI, in the

112
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,280
Matomo UI, saying, do you want the unique visitor? Or just a warning saying, OK, by default, it's not

113
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,840
activated, but you can choose to activate it. Again, it's a presentation that's really

114
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:58,440
orientated for non-technical people. And yes, this is something I encountered a lot of times.

115
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:06,600
And now I can warn my clients about that. But in the beginning, when it happened, it was a bit

116
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:15,720
disturbing. And thank you again, Thomas, for the comments about that.

117
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:34,360
Another thing that I think could be interesting is that—I'm sorry, I'm reading Thomas' comment,

118
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:55,640
but I think the stuff could be a little bit strange. OK, let's go on. OK, the other thing

119
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,080
is about generic segments, because by default, you don't have anything like that in the interface.

120
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:12,680
So I think that you should have, by default, some kind of generic segments that you have within

121
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:29,320
Google Analytics. So again, it's a marketing guy talking. Some tools like Adobe Analytics or other

122
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:41,640
don't even have those generic segments available. But again, for people that are used to something

123
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:50,600
and that are moving to a new tool, not having the basics is something that is a bit annoying.

124
00:18:50,600 --> 00:19:00,680
So I think that at least there could be some kind of generic ones like the direct accesses,

125
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:15,320
new users, stuff like that. Another stuff that existed in Google Analytics and that people

126
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:26,120
don't find in Matomo and about what they're a bit disappointed is the value page metric.

127
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,840
This metric is interesting because it was a simple way to identify

128
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,800
what pages were contributing to performance to conversions. And I think it could be interesting

129
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:54,440
to have this data within Matomo. I'm reading the comments. Sorry for joking a bit.

130
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,680
It's a very complex tool and you just read that we can adopt it for different needs. However,

131
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:12,440
you should know these details. Of course, configure it with the setting above

132
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:23,560
enable as an example. Yes, I totally agree. It was the situation that I encountered in

133
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:34,680
the beginning when I started working with the tool. But yes, it's something that I know now.

134
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,320
But for people that are going to be using the tool in the future since there are going to be a lot of

135
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,480
adoption of the tool because of the legal situation in different countries, I think that

136
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:58,120
at least the tool should warn users that they have to do something about that. Because not anyone

137
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:07,320
has the immediate knowledge about this specific topic, the unique visitor topic.

138
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:25,080
The tag manager. Another thing that could be done is just to allow us to sort the different assets

139
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:35,640
by name types because here you have really few things, few tags. But when you have really big

140
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:42,600
containers, I think that if you could sort by name, by type, or even have a search field

141
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:54,360
somewhere could be a good thing as well. In the tag manager area, again, something

142
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,520
that I think could be interesting is just to have a way to duplicate, copy, paste some sets

143
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:10,600
because right now you can just edit or delete the assets. Something else that already exists in

144
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:19,000
Google Tag Manager is the folder feature. So maybe could be also a good thing to be able to have a

145
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:31,000
clean vision of what's inside your container. A way also to post tags, something you have quite

146
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,760
easily in Google Tag Manager that you don't have in Matomo. Of course, you can decide that you

147
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:47,000
put some kind of starting day and ending day of the tag file for a campaign, for instance. But

148
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:58,040
this is quite easy to use here to just post the tag. Number three is about data visualization.

149
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:09,640
Again, I'm talking only for me. I don't know an open source Google Data Studio alternative.

150
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,840
I think that there are some, so for instance, here, I think it's Grafana, and I think that there's a

151
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:27,560
talk soon about Apache superset. But again, you have to go outside of Matomo. So I think that if

152
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:36,760
we can have something that allows us to stay within Matomo, could be a good thing. If we can

153
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:46,680
do that, could be a good thing. Or another option is to enhance the existing dashboard

154
00:23:47,480 --> 00:24:00,840
system and maybe make other connections possible because with the existing dashboard, you cannot

155
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:10,520
connect external data sources. So yes, just as the A-B testing feature, I think that it's a big

156
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:20,680
work to do, but to have something complete, I think it's important to have a complete data

157
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:32,200
visualization solution within Matomo. The last thing I wanted to talk about regarding my ideal

158
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:40,280
vision, it's not exhaustive, but just a few ideas I had in mind, is about the consent management

159
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:50,360
platform. So again, if you have the technical resources for that, you can address

160
00:24:50,360 --> 00:25:03,960
this topic. But I think if we had something internal inside of Matomo that can allow us

161
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:14,760
to create the cookie consent banner and configure it easily, it would help to adopt the tool.

162
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,720
So there is a comment here, page metric about goal conversion is a new feature since two months.

163
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:31,560
Goal conversion. Thank you Udo for your comment.

164
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:43,960
Yes, and now it's your turn. Do you have any ideas about what could make Matomo even a better tool?

165
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,480
Just feel free and we'll take note of that and add it to the presentation. So

166
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,720
if you want to add something, just don't hesitate.

167
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,160
Regarding consent management, I would like that it would be nice

168
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:13,720
if it can be possible to process content to geo location with a full IP address.

169
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:23,480
Thank you Udo for your comment. Small improvements to the current dashboard solution

170
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:31,880
would help a lot. Building a completely new dashboard solution is a big test. Yes, totally agree.

171
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:48,920
Again, I'm just dreaming awake, but it's the name of the presentation. It's ideal. Imagine an ideal Matomo.

172
00:26:48,920 --> 00:27:03,160
Michael Johnson is saying, would also like to have faster responses, but it is surely a technical thing.

173
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,800
Faster, also like to have faster. Yes, I think they were talking about

174
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:28,120
server responses on your Matomo UI. Typically, you can be helped by your IT team, and you can also

175
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:42,600
ask some people. In particular, I'm thinking about Peter, with whom I have already been working.

176
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:55,960
His work brought a lot of improvement to the time response. Peter is definitely

177
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:06,280
someone you can reach out to when you want to address these technical issues that can cause low response.

178
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,040
Udo is saying, I totally agree. Marketing clients in particular see like you that some of your

179
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:20,520
improvements would help a lot. Thank you for your comments. I think that it's also a matter of

180
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:28,760
internal communication within the tool, just to, again, like for the unique business stuff, just

181
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,320
some kind of pop-up saying, okay, for the moment, you don't have access to that metric, but if you want

182
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,400
to have it, because it's a must-have, then you just have to go to the config in the PHP and make that

183
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:46,280
change. I think it's like when there's a conversation between people, it's a matter of

184
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:56,120
anticipate what can happen and communicate in a clear way. Yes, thank you again, Udo, for your

185
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:06,440
comment. Thank you, Thomas, for your comment also. Indeed, it's like in most cases, there are some

186
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:16,520
limitations in the architecture for some features as well. Yes, of course, and just like Thomas said,

187
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,080
yes, it is a very complex tool, and I know that in my position, I don't have an overall vision of

188
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:37,720
all the involvements to make the tool work, but I had this discussion with Mathieu some weeks ago,

189
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:47,320
months ago. There are at least, I think, three audiences for the tool. You have end users for

190
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,200
marketing people in an organization that are going to be looking at their campaign performance, for

191
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,040
instance. You have IT people that are going to be installing and managing the infrastructure,

192
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:07,720
and you have consultants like me, people like me, and these are really three different types of

193
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:17,800
audiences with different expectations. When we're talking about Matomo consultants, and I take my

194
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:26,920
example, I am a Matomo consultant, but with not that technical orientation, I'm more a digital

195
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:37,720
efficiency strategist, so I think it's really important to have communications, distinct

196
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:45,720
communication for these three different types of audiences. And Udo is asking, Thomas, what are your

197
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:54,920
thoughts on the technical limitations, not specifically on the technical limitations,

198
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:04,920
but not specifically on the technical limitations?

199
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:15,480
Yes, but regarding the limitations, I have to admit that I'm not that aware of all the limitations,

200
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,560
and I think that there is a page on the documentation that explains all the

201
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:27,560
all the documentations, and my final thought about that is that the tool needs improvement,

202
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:34,600
yes, it's clear, but I think that communication around the tool needs improvement as well,

203
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:43,800
because I'm going to give a last example about that. The example I want to give is the

204
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,520
Tag Manager implementation of the e-commerce tracking, and I have to admit that I struggled

205
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:55,480
a bit with the official documentation, and the solution with that came from Ronan Hélot,

206
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:03,160
who wrote an article on his blog, and that definitely changed my life to enable the tracking

207
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:11,080
of the e-commerce with the Tag Manager. So yes, I think that improvement around the tool can

208
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:19,240
is necessary, and improvement around communication documentation is also necessary, because

209
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,480
today, customers are used to have a Tag Manager, because they can handle their campaigns

210
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:34,200
more easily, and they expect the tracking to be done with the Tag Manager, and I see that

211
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:42,680
and I see that these different situations of, okay, am I going to use the regular JavaScript

212
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:50,040
tracker, or am I going to use the Tag Manager, or am I going to use an SDK for an application,

213
00:32:50,040 --> 00:33:06,040
but you don't have some kind of detailed approach, or maybe I haven't seen it, but yes. Finally,

214
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:13,000
what I think is that the communication around the tool can be improved also.

215
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,160
Improved also. The limitations are mostly about not a mobile user. In relation to database, this

216
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:25,560
works for small sites, but when data grows, the query gets heavier from a tech perspective.

217
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,040
In some cases, then the need for super skilled DBA skills is needed.

218
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:50,760
Okay, so thanks a lot for your comments, your suggestions. I'm really glad that we had this

219
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:59,720
discussion all together. I think that we are going to end the talk. Just like I said, I'm going to ask

220
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:10,040
some of the propositions you suggested in the chat, and thanks for your attention,

221
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:21,320
and we talk soon. See you very soon, I hope. Bye.
