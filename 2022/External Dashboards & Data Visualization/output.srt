1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,080
All right, hello, and welcome, everyone, for our next presentation.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,400
This will be given by our speaker, Michael Weber.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,440
Michael Weber has been working in online marketing and analytics for over 20 years, and he's

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:29,560
the founder of Search VIU, which is a provider of data solutions, especially for SEO purposes.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,400
And he has developed a Matomo Google Data Studio Connector.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,560
Today, he will talk about looking at external data visualization solutions and how and,

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,800
if yes, they can be integrated with Matomo.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,080
So, without further ado, I am looking forward to your presentation, Michael, and please

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
begin.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Thank you, Clemens.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Thank you for the introduction.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:06,040
It is a pleasure to be here today and to talk about external data dashboards and data visualization.

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,960
So, yes, let's start with a little about me.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:22,840
You have said all already, yes, I'm in online marketing, web analytics since 2001, worked

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:33,520
in agencies and in-house, yes, don't want to talk a long, long time about just one thing.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,400
We have developed a Matomo Google Looker Studio Connector, just could be that in the presentation

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,720
I talk about Google Data Studio, Google has renamed it before some time, and yes, that's

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,720
about that.

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:02,200
What I will talk about today, a short look on why we do, why external data visualization

20
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:12,080
could be important, and a short look on what solutions are out there, it's just a short

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,640
look, we don't dig into the several things there.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
And then we take a look on the data transfer options.

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:31,920
So what's linked with that is how we get the Matomo data into any sort of visualization

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,120
solution out there, and we dig a little bit deeper in how that works, how we work with

25
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:49,120
data, what we need to consider when we do that, and at the end, I think it's enough

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,800
time to answer some questions.

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes, so why should you or should anybody use external data visualizations?

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:15,440
Matomo has pretty powerful dashboards, and for that, there are many widgets out there,

29
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,120
but yeah, it's a little bit limited in the visualization of the data.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:34,080
The widgets are not as good in time series visualization of some data and other things.

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:42,640
That's one thing, the visualization of the data is important for several audiences.

32
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:57,400
If you want to build a management KPI dashboard, in addition for some other people in the business,

33
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,880
some other stakeholders in the business, in your company, it makes sense to build own

34
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:11,720
dashboards for them, filter it already down so the people don't have to click through

35
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,240
Matomo and find their reports and so on.

36
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:27,880
One other thing is that in the most visualization solutions out there, it's possible to connect

37
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,360
data at other data sources, so you could add, as an example, if you want to make a report

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:47,400
for the SCA BPC team, you can add data directly and other data from Matomo in one dashboard.

39
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:55,560
Also Matomo has some integrations, it's not as powerful as some other tool out there.

40
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:04,120
So yes, just a short look at our audience.

41
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:13,800
Is anybody of you using already an external visualization solution from Matomo data already?

42
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:24,840
I have created a poll in the chat if you want to answer, it would be great.

43
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:35,840
So give you two seconds to go into that.

44
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:50,240
As far as I can see, at the moment, the most people who have entered the poll haven't used

45
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
it already.

46
00:05:51,240 --> 00:06:00,600
So yes, we will take a look.

47
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:10,680
What are data visualization solutions or what visualization solutions out there on the market?

48
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:22,440
Matomo is Lukas Studio or Google Data Studio, I think it's pretty known out there.

49
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:30,440
But there are other great solutions like Tableau, Power BI, CSEN, SOA Analytics, all the open

50
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:40,360
source solutions from Apache, SuperSet, but there are a wide range of other solutions.

51
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:57,040
So yes, it's something where data can be visualized.

52
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:05,600
Lukas Studio is for free and it's also a free host, SuperSet is also a free open source

53
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:13,040
tool, but you need some hosting there, and other tools are in the SOA Analytics is also

54
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:21,360
open source, as far as I know, the other solutions are paid versions with a different range to

55
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,760
you need to pay.

56
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:33,000
And yes, see some more people have voted in the poll.

57
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,280
And we have some people here who already have done data visualizations, that's great.

58
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,320
So perhaps they can add some information at the end.

59
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:58,600
So now, if we have a data visualization solution, we need the data from Matomo to get in that

60
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
visualization.

61
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,120
There are several options to transfer the data.

62
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:15,280
The one is the API, which Matomo provides, the other is to have access to the SQL database.

63
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:25,360
The most visualization tools have the possibility to add a SQL data source.

64
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:34,080
And one other solution is data transfer, so you export data from Matomo into an external

65
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,000
analytic database, as example, to analyze with them.

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:51,120
If we take a look on the API option, some benefits are that the data is up to date,

67
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:59,600
you just talk to Matomo with the API, it's mostly the easiest way to get access to the

68
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:08,840
data and you have no extra cost or maintenance of additional database or something like this.

69
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:18,400
The cons are that the connector, that there must be a connector to Matomo available in

70
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:28,640
the visualization solution, or you need to develop one, or it must be a workaround there,

71
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,320
we take a look at this later.

72
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:41,240
It could be slow, like other solutions, if you want to access wide range of data, also

73
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,320
we take a look at that.

74
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,600
And the API, that's something that needs to be mentioned.

75
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,200
Much people have worked with Google Analytics before, and perhaps they know the Data Studio

76
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,560
Connector from Google Analytics, and the Matomo API is not as flexible like the Google Analytics

77
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
API.

78
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:13,000
In Google Analytics, you say, I want to have that dimension with that metric and combine

79
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:22,440
them and use them, that's not so easy with the Matomo API.

80
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,840
Let's take a look on the SQL database access.

81
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,440
The pro is the most visualization solutions has a connector for MySQL, that's easy, so

82
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,560
you don't need to develop one or something like this.

83
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,760
And if you have access to the database, you also have access to the raw data from Google

84
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,400
Analytics to build reports which are based on that.

85
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:59,280
But the cons are that setting up a secure connection to the database from the visualization

86
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:09,480
solution could be difficult, because you need to be sure no other people out there can,

87
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,000
access your MySQL database.

88
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And if you are using aggregated analytics data, so these predefined Matomo tables, the

89
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,480
same thing like in the API is that you don't have the flexibility like in Google Analytics.

90
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,840
And it can harm the data page performance if you try to use that raw locked data to

91
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,120
build the reports.

92
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,800
So you must be careful there.

93
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:50,440
One other con is that it's not available in the Matomo cloud, so you don't have access

94
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,560
to the SQL database there.

95
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:02,680
The other last option is to transfer data out of Matomo and save them in, as example,

96
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Google BigQuery.

97
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:13,600
So you can use a service or a solution like Abyte, which is an ELT toolset, where you

98
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:23,440
can say, oh, grab the data from the raw Matomo API, put it into BigQuery, and make something

99
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,440
there.

100
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,920
If you want to do that, it has some pros.

101
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,120
So analytic database connectors are also available in the most visualization solutions.

102
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,560
You can work directly with the locked data because there's no restriction of some performance

103
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,680
hints if you work with them.

104
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,520
And you can combine metrics, dimensions in another way, like with the predefined data

105
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,080
sets on Matomo, and it's fast on large data sets.

106
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,760
Cons are, yeah, setting up the data transfer could be difficult.

107
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,280
You need to write some complex SQL queries.

108
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:19,120
And yeah, you can calculate additional codes for the data transfer from Matomo to the analytics

109
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,360
database, and you must pay the analytics database.

110
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
That is something.

111
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:35,360
So if we compare, the API is really easy, and the cost is minimal, or none, if you use

112
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
it.

113
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,840
And you have a little bit of restriction and flexibility compared to the other solutions.

114
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:51,560
The SQL database access, yes, not as easy to access as the API.

115
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,200
Most could be medium if you want to think, but if you want to, you have direct access

116
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,400
to the database, it's also small.

117
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,760
And you're a little more flexible, like the API solution.

118
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:15,400
Data transfer is really complex in most cases, the costs are higher, but it's more flexible.

119
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:23,160
So if you have some requirements, other solutions can't give you this, this could be a solution.

120
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:31,200
In the next slides, we won't take a deeper look at the data transfer part, because it's

121
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,240
much more complex.

122
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,800
We stay with the API or the SQL database access.

123
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:53,880
So if we have some people who have said that they are using an external visualization solution,

124
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,720
which data transfer option are you using?

125
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:06,680
Is it API, SQL, or transfer to external, just type in text to get an overview of what you

126
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,360
are using.

127
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,240
I will take a look at the chat later, and that would be great to get a look inside.

128
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:28,200
So now we talk about getting the data into the visualization solution a little bit based

129
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,000
on these transfer methods.

130
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,280
There are some options, so the one is the native connector.

131
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:47,200
So if a solution has a native connector to Matomo, you can use that, and it's the most

132
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,620
easiest way.

133
00:15:49,620 --> 00:16:00,120
We take a look at a workaround with Google Sheets, where you can use the API to use that,

134
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:10,760
and we will take a look on the SQL connector, that's the most solutions.

135
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:22,480
So we have some answers in the chat, it's a wide range of these options, we have some

136
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,720
who are using the APIs, someone using the SQL database, I don't see someone who uses

137
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,840
data transfers in some way.

138
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:44,920
So API and SQL database is I think the most used options here for the most people.

139
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:57,240
So yes, to get data into a solution, it's mentioned Google Data Studio, but in the most

140
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,960
cases other solutions are also connected to Google Sheets.

141
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:11,960
So it could work also for other data visualization tools.

142
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:20,720
And the process is you have the possibility to, below each chart you have an option to

143
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:29,480
export data, and you have the option to export data and get the URL, and with a workaround

144
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,280
you can export the data in Google Sheets.

145
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,840
So the data is then in Google Sheets, and you can configure the visualization tool to

146
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,720
use that Google Sheets as data source.

147
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,960
You will find here two links where Matomo, there's some information on Matomo Org is

148
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,960
and some other who describes these process step by step.

149
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,880
The best, it's a free solution for getting Matomo data into a data visualization tool.

150
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,360
So that's a great benefit for that, but you need some time to set this up for different

151
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,280
charts and sources.

152
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:24,080
For each, not for each, but for each report you want to have to be shown as a data visualization

153
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,920
tool, you need to add one spreadsheet that you write in there and so on.

154
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,080
And there are some limits based on the data range, possibilities, filters, and segments

155
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,400
must be predefined and so on.

156
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:56,080
Then I've taken a look on the possibilities about connectors to the solutions out there.

157
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,160
The Looker Studio has a Matomo connector available, it's developed by us, so some advertising

158
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,000
here, but for the other solutions we haven't found some.

159
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,640
If someone knows it, it would be great, so we can add it here.

160
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:22,040
I've seen at 16 o'clock there is a session by Thomas Persson about open source dashboards

161
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,760
on top on Matomo with Apache superset.

162
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,520
I don't know what it is, I will take a look into it also, I think it's interesting for

163
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,720
all who participate here.

164
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:44,320
I think there's no connector, he uses the SQL access directly, but we will see later.

165
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:53,320
So yes, at the moment a native connector is only available for Looker Studio at the moment.

166
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:04,680
So what we need to know, I've mentioned it a little bit earlier, is what is the structure

167
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,360
of the Matomo data when we want to work with that.

168
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,880
You have different reports here on the left in the navigation of Matomo about visitors

169
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:26,560
behavior, accretion, and so on, and Matomo data is structured in that way that mostly

170
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:37,280
each of these reports has its own table in the database with the pre-processed data,

171
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
so the data can be loaded fast.

172
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,280
MySQL has no analytics database, so this pre-processing is needed.

173
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:53,520
And each report has its own API request and its own dimensions and metrics in combination.

174
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,720
You can't, if, as example, the campaign report has a campaign name, you can't add another

175
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,680
dimension because it's not pre-processed.

176
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:15,600
So you need to keep in mind regarding what solutions if connector, Google Sheets or SQL,

177
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:23,040
for each of these reports you need to create your own data source in most cases.

178
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:31,000
So you work later with different data sources, one for Geo, one for visitors, one for campaigns

179
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:44,040
if you want to build a dashboard, it's recommended to name them good so you find the data later.

180
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:54,240
So with that in mind, the steps for creating a chart are the same for different charts.

181
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,080
So the first thing is the configuration, you need to know which site, which report you

182
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,400
want to have, and also create segments of filters if needed.

183
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,800
And then you have configured it in the Data Studio Connector or the Looker Connector,

184
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,680
it looks like this.

185
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:27,800
In Matomo itself, you will see where the data is, grab that report and put, grab that table

186
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,840
or chart, et cetera, and copy the export URL.

187
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,320
Then you need to connect the data, that's the next step.

188
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:48,880
So if you have the API URL, import a spreadsheet, set up a schedule, and import the schema from

189
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,440
that, the same for the SQL database, you need to choose the table or use the connector.

190
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,960
After that, you have the schema for that data source and can work with the data.

191
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,800
And the last step is then, it's the same for all these solutions, is to visualize the data

192
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:12,320
so you have the possibility from range of dimensions and metrics to create time series,

193
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,160
bar charts, map charts, et cetera.

194
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:25,240
So that are the different steps to do that.

195
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:36,840
So one thing, if you want to work with, if you have some requirements to use real dimensions

196
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:47,440
and metrics who are not in one of these pre-prepared reports, you need to create a custom report.

197
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:59,080
So as an example, if you want to know what campaigns work in what countries, so you need

198
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:07,520
two dimensions, country and campaign, and you want to know what's the results, what's

199
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,960
the bounce rate and so on, you need to create a custom report on that.

200
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,840
This custom report, you can import in the data visualization tool like the other options

201
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:26,600
that after you have created it, it's the same process there, but that's the only way to

202
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:37,200
combine dimensions and metrics which are not in one of these default reports already combined.

203
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,760
If you work with the API or also SQL, there are some performance considerations, especially

204
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,880
if you work with some dashboards.

205
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:57,680
Loading data from a Tomo is fast in the normal dashboard settings, but it can also be slow.

206
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,920
Just a little example, if you request results over time over the last 12 months compared

207
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:12,040
with the previous period with the selected segment, you can take over 30 seconds or longer.

208
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:19,640
In that case, also in the Tomo Cloud for the demo side, out there, there are much bigger

209
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:30,600
size and data sets, so yeah, the loading can be really tough there.

210
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:40,400
If you have more data and requesting longer timeframes, add filter segments that can also

211
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,600
expand the loading time.

212
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:58,440
For that, here are some tips we have discovered while people working with our Data Studio

213
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,600
Connector.

214
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:11,960
If you use the spreadsheet solution, that's not the case in most parts because it's pre-processed,

215
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:19,000
but if you're using the Data Connector or MySQL Access, we recommend to use a smaller

216
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:28,160
date range in the default view of the dashboard, so just select the month and not three years.

217
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:38,280
Add a date range if needed, and add a date range control if someone wants to get a longer

218
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,280
date range there.

219
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,960
Avoid the main metrics report.

220
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:55,600
It's a report which comes through the API where much metrics are in, but it takes longer

221
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:04,960
to load, in the most cases, most metrics are also in some sub-reports.

222
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,560
Avoid transferring a big amount of result rows, so if you have a landing page list and

223
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:18,800
you want to report the top landing page and you have 5 million ULs, don't send them all

224
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:27,280
to the data visualization tool and then cut them in Matomo.

225
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:37,880
Just get the top 100 rows with a filter option and show them in the visualization tool.

226
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,160
One other thing is to use custom reports.

227
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:51,920
If you have a complex query with segments and landing page ULs containing and so on,

228
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,480
create a custom report so it's pre-filled and you can only access the data instead of

229
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:07,080
each data visualization request you need to segment and filter the reports by itself.

230
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,920
One other option is to reduce the number of elements loaded at one time, so not to show

231
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:24,240
500 charts on one page, reduce it to a good amount.

232
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:37,400
In Looker Studio there's an option which is named extract data, if you use that, it extracts

233
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:48,160
the data from the source, stores it somewhere in the Google Cloud and you do only the access

234
00:28:48,160 --> 00:29:01,200
against this fast storage and it gets the updates each night and you have a fast report.

235
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,320
That could be a solution, especially if you want to show a page time range from three

236
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,840
years and filter down by, so that could be a solution.

237
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:26,160
So yes, that was a rough overview about the topic data visualization, how data can go

238
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:39,520
from a Tomo to a visualization solution and what options are there and how that works.

239
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:47,400
Any questions from the audience here at the moment?

240
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,360
Thank you very much, Marcel.

241
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,760
If questions, any questions, please drop them in the chat.

242
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,840
Just to also inform you about this, there's a 40-second delay between the stream and the

243
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,080
chat room, so that's also why the poll was a bit delayed, I think.

244
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:12,480
I mean, already in the chat there's still a few answers about the question what people

245
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:22,120
are using for connectors and also a few fan messages, I think.

246
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Thanks.

247
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,400
I get it, right?

248
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:35,960
So I see some answers, I've seen someone also exporting data through the GUI to show

249
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,920
them visualization solutions.

250
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:47,200
I think the spreadsheet variant could be then something who helps there to reduce the amount

251
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:59,480
of work and Thomas has written that for superset he built an own connector with SQL, so that

252
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,000
could be interesting in the session from him later.

253
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,520
I see there are actually some questions now as well.

254
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,320
So there's a question that Diana Ferber wrote that they are working on moving away from

255
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,800
Google Analytics using the non-privacy-friendly point as one of the main reasons.

256
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:25,520
So that question is how privacy-friendly is it to move the data back to Google Data Studio?

257
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,120
Yes, good question.

258
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm not a lawyer, so just my opinion at that point.

259
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:49,440
If you are using Data Matomo to get the data saved somewhere, it depends how your setup

260
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
is.

261
00:31:50,440 --> 00:32:01,240
If you have no customer data in your instance and just working with aggregated data and

262
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:12,160
so on, there's no personal data in there, so the IP is blocked by Matomo and so on.

263
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:20,880
So in my opinion, if there's no personal data in Matomo, you can't transfer it to any service

264
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,480
without harming your DSP flow and so on.

265
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,080
Yes, that's the one thing, if you have customer data in there, like order ID or something

266
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:50,160
like this, if you do that, it depends how your tracking is set up there and if you have

267
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,600
a reason for having it in Matomo already and you have access to it and some people have

268
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:04,720
said yes, you can save it, you can also, you need to check your lawyer if you can transfer

269
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:12,120
such data to a data studio if you have a contract with them, but yes, that's something you need

270
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,040
to check out there.

271
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,720
But as long as you have no personal data in Matomo, you can transfer, in my opinion, to

272
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
any tool out there.

273
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:29,080
It's just statistical data.

274
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:40,320
Another question by Niklas Terenstedt is if you can show an example of a visualization.

275
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,400
So the question is what do you mean by an example of a visualization?

276
00:33:47,400 --> 00:34:04,200
I can show you something if I, let me see if that works here.

277
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,000
That is Luka, our data studio, Luka Studio.

278
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,400
I've created here a data source with, in that case, our connector, but that has explained

279
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:21,600
that could also be a SQL connection or a spreadsheet workaround there.

280
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:30,560
And yes, you have then these data source and you have the different dimensions and metrics

281
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
in here.

282
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,720
That is the channel type report.

283
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:42,080
So I have the channel type and here I've chosen the channel type and the wizards and have

284
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,400
made a normal time series chart.

285
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:55,960
And you can then change it to, I don't want to filter here, change the metric as example

286
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,680
to the order revenue or something else, what is available from the API call.

287
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:12,040
You could also make other charts from the same data as this one is just aggregated scorecard.

288
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:20,800
And you could also do some by charts the same way or change the charts in different ways

289
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:30,720
to make your visualizations here and it shows the data you need.

290
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:42,280
So there are much guides for visualization data in data studio out there.

291
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:50,000
I think that's something which is covered there already, but yes, it's the same procedure.

292
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,080
You have a data source with one of the, from one of the reports in Matomo and you can use

293
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:02,000
it here to visualize the data the way you like.

294
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,960
So that doesn't make sense here, the source should be the channel type.

295
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,320
Yes, I hope that answers that question.

296
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I hope so too.

297
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,960
I mean, the person who asked the question is now still typing in chat.

298
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:32,400
So maybe you just, we have to wait a few seconds for the delay to allow them to reply.

299
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:46,400
So yes, well, in the meantime, okay.

300
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:55,880
So if there are no other questions, I mean, the chat room will remain open for further

301
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,480
discussions anyways.

302
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,000
I would once again like to thank you very much for your talk, for your very insightful

303
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,400
talk and yes, thanks a lot.

304
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Thank you.

305
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:16,600
Thank you very much for listening and if you have any questions later, you can contact

306
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,400
me on LinkedIn or via email.

307
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Yes.

308
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Yeah.

309
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Thank you.

310
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Thank you.

311
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Thank you very much.
