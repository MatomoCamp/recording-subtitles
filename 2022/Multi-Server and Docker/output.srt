00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello and welcome to the second MatomoCamp, it's really great to have everyone here again.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,080
My name is Richard Stark, I'm one of the support team members here with Matomo and today we're

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,160
going to be talking about multi-server setups for Matomo and we're going to have a little

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,440
practical walkthrough on setting up Matomo with a Docker image that we can use for multi-server

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,840
deployments.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,240
So you might be asking yourself what exactly is a multi-server setup?

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,160
A multi-server setup Matomo is when we have multiple different application servers and

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,400
multiple web servers that are all working together to serve requests, to handle tracking

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,160
requests or UI requests, we can have dedicated servers to run core archive command for example.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,240
The goal for that is basically to have many different servers working together to handle

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
all the requests.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,480
The benefit of this of course is that we can scale up these multiple different servers

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,840
quite easily when we have high traffic and we can scale down again and have low amounts

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,920
of traffic.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,200
It also gives us some really great redundancy so that if a specific server has an error

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,920
we can quickly remove that server from the pool of servers and continue on without losing

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,960
much or without losing any data at all.

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,720
So one of the most important things when we're talking about a multi-server deployment for

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,800
Matomo is that we need to have the same code base deployed across all of the different

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,340
servers.

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,040
So this would be the same version of Matomo, the same plugin files and that sort of information.

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,960
If we have for example one server that's out of date or we have one server that doesn't

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,340
have the same plugins that the rest of the servers are, it's going to be serving the

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,440
wrong version of the Matomo tracking code.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,440
It might not be able to process all of the tracking requests that we send to that server

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,740
so it could cause some data loss as well.

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,120
So apart from the code base there are some other files that we also want to synchronize.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,480
These are files such as our config files, it's something that we would expect to edit

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,520
from time to time so we wouldn't have to want to have to go through a redeployment

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,720
every time we change the config file so that's not something that we would want to bake into

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,640
our deployment image.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,440
The other thing as well is custom user files so these are things like your favicon or your

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
logo.

34
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,080
If you change that through the UI obviously you want to make sure that that is synchronized

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,720
across all of the different servers.

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,040
There are some things that we also need to do in a multi-server environment in terms

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,960
of configuration so we'll have a look at those configuration settings further on when we're

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,120
busy with the setup.

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,880
We're going to be using a couple different tools today.

40
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,720
One of those tools obviously is Docker.

41
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,840
We need to have Docker installed server or device that we're going to be using this on.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,720
The other thing that we're going to be using today is Portainer CE, Portainer Community

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Edition.

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,760
It's a really nice graphical user interface that we can use to make our lives a little

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
bit easier.

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,080
It's also a little bit easier to do a video on.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,440
Not many people want to spend 30 to 40 minutes staring at a terminal screen so we're going

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,360
to be using the graphical user interface.

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,060
The benefit of this as well is it's quite similar to a lot of other container or Docker

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:32,920
orchestration tools that you'll probably be familiar with in other systems as well.

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,700
So we'll start off by going to the containers and we'll create a new container.

52
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,760
So for the name we'll just give this Tomo for now and then for the Docker image we want

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,200
to set this to Tomo Latest Version.

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,360
We'll scroll down here to the bottom and we'll set up a bind mount.

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,720
Now this bind mount is specifically done so that we can synchronize our config file.

56
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,040
So for now what we'll do is we'll put the location of a folder beside the container

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,600
that we know is going to exist.

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,400
It's not going to be something that is deleted if we volume or something like that.

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,240
So that that file can exist so we can create a similar link for it later on in the process.

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Then for the host portion this is going to be wherever you have your config file set

61
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,920
up on a network share.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,560
So this could be for example an FF share, it could be some other type of shared network

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,040
location.

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
In the example today there is no config file present.

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,800
We're going to be creating that config file but if you already have a config file set

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,480
up for Tomo with your database and everything configured you can reuse that existing configuration

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
file.

68
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,560
And then to make life a little bit easier with the setup today we're just going to

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,960
change the network to host and click deploy container.

70
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Once that is running we'll click on the little icon over here that looks like a console.

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,400
That's so that we can execute into the container so we can run a couple of mounts.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,960
We'll leave everything as default here to connect as the root user.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,040
And the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to run an apt update.

74
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,400
This is so that we can install a couple of other tools that we're going to be using

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,320
during the process today and those tools are cron, unzip and nano so that we can edit a

76
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,520
couple of files.

77
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,040
So we'll hit yes there when that asks us to and we'll give that a minute to shut

78
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,880
installing.

79
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,920
Next we're going to change the directory of where we are right now from the working

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,460
directory for the mitomo codebase to the source directory for the mitomo codebase.

81
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,080
And then we're going to download a script file.

82
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,360
This script file is specifically so that we can automate the process of downloading all

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,640
of the different plugins.

84
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,800
Once that is downloaded we'll do a chmod command to make that file executable.

85
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,240
And then we'll edit that file.

86
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,160
Alright, so what we want to do is we want to grab our license key.

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,960
In that third line where it shows license key is to just paste that into the file.

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,320
Hit control O to save and control X to exit.

89
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,560
Once that is done we have our file placed or our license key placed into the file.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,200
We'll run the script file.

91
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,160
So the benefit of using the Docker image in this case is we have access to that environment

92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,720
variable so we can make sure that when we run this command or if you eventually copy

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,600
paste this command into your Docker container you can be 100% certain that you're getting

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,280
the correct version of plugins for the version of mitomo that you are running.

95
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,960
The plugins that it's downloading here specifically are the premium bundle plugins as well as

96
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,200
a couple of the extra optional plugins that we recommend having installed.

97
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,920
If you do not have a premium bundle plugin license you will need to edit the script so

98
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,760
that you can move those files.

99
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,960
If you have some other optional files or optional plugins that you do want to install that are

100
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,720
not included in that script you can also edit those in and add them to the script file.

101
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
Next we're going to move all of the plugins that we've just downloaded into the correct

102
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,680
directory and we'll clean up behind ourselves and just remove some of those empty folders

103
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,720
and that script file because we're not going to need that script file anymore.

104
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,280
Next we're going to be setting up a crontab for the www data user.

105
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,320
The first crontab that we're going to set up is specifically for the custom js update

106
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,520
command.

107
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,120
So it might sound strange to say I don't have any custom js on my server.

108
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,400
What this command does is that every minute on the minute it runs this command to update

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,920
the Matomo.js file so that it has all of the correct tracking code for all of the plugins

110
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
that you have installed.

111
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,760
A lot of the plugins and especially some of the premium plugins are designed in a way

112
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,760
that if you're not using them, if you're not tracking any data for them, they're not

113
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,280
going to add their tracking code to the Matomo.js file just to keep that file as small as possible.

114
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,840
This is specifically the case for things like the eat maps or session recordings and we

115
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,520
also want to do a similar sort of crontab for the tag manager.

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,600
This is important because if you edit a tag manager container through the UI and you click

117
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,920
update or save or publish, that command is only going to be executed on the server that

118
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,760
you are directly connected to through the UI.

119
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,040
So this will make sure that those container files are updated across all of the different

120
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
servers continuously.

121
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,920
Once that's done, we'll hit control O to save and we'll hit control X.

122
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,840
Next, we want to download our geolocation database.

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,400
Again, we're going to make some use of some environment variables just to make our lives

124
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,280
a little bit easier when you copy pasting these commands and we'll download that.

125
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:22,200
Next, we're going to unzip that file and we will rename the file and move it to the correct

126
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,400
folder.

127
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:32,360
Now that that is done, we have a mostly working code base that we can use for Matomo.

128
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:49,880
And what we'll do is we'll connect directly to that Matomo server.

129
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,560
Looks like we're connected to HTTPS there.

130
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,960
All right, now we're going to be going through the database creation setup for Matomo.

131
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,040
So we'll go through our system check over here.

132
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,800
Everything looks good.

133
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,680
For the database, this is hosted on the same host as the Docker installation, so we'll

134
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,480
leave everything as default.

135
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,960
This is going to be different depending on how you have things set up.

136
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:25,640
Server, so we'll type our password in there, our database name, and then you can select

137
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:34,240
your data table prefix over here, click next, and have the database installation done in

138
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,200
just a couple of seconds.

139
00:10:40,200 --> 00:11:02,640
It seems to be taking its time today.

140
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,520
There we go.

141
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,360
Oh, it's taking us back to the start of the thing.

142
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,640
I'm not sure what happened there.

143
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,080
We'll just go through that step again and see if we can get things working.

144
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:32,440
Let's see if we can get it going second time.

145
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:49,520
Type our password, select Matomo database, and today, let's give this a different table

146
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:58,000
prefix just in case something already triggered on the previous install, that just a second.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
There we go.

148
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Tables are created.

149
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,400
Now, we do need to go through the setup process because this is a new install of setting up

150
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
the superuser.

151
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:25,120
We can sign up to Newsletter if you want to, do that for this fake email address, and then

152
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,960
we will give our new website a name and time zone.

153
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:40,240
All right, now that this is set up, we just need to ask a couple of steps to make sure

154
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,360
that everything is working.

155
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:54,760
All right, so that is working, so we can go back to our retainer page over here, and what

156
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,280
we're going to do now is we're going to move the configuration file that has just been

157
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,600
created, the working directory for Matomo, into the source directory that we were talking

158
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
about here.

159
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:14,280
All right, once that is done, we're going to edit the entry script, entry point script

160
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,440
specifically for the Docker container.

161
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:25,960
This is so that we can run a symlink command specifically for when the Docker container

162
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,160
starts up.

163
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,280
So we'll copy that symlink command directly to the file, and then we'll hit Ctrl-O to

164
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,360
save, Ctrl-X to exit.

165
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,760
Next, we're going to edit the config file that we've just moved to the source location,

166
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,320
and we're going to install some of those, or going to set up some of those config options

167
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,440
that we were talking about earlier.

168
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,800
The first config option that we're going to do is to be able to tell Matomo that we're

169
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,480
working with a multi-server environment.

170
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,440
What this does is in a lot of the places where it would be enabled by default, it tries to

171
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,080
prevent Matomo from writing to the config file very often.

172
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,040
It also disables certain options that wouldn't normally work in a multi-server environment

173
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,160
just to prevent any sorts of issues.

174
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,100
The next thing that we also want to do is we want to disable the plugin administration

175
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,760
option.

176
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,320
Because we're running on a multi-server environment for Matomo, we cannot install or activate

177
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,800
or deactivate plugins through the UI.

178
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,080
We need to do that through the command line, because it also is going to require us to

179
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:44,440
edit our base image and to do a redeployment of the entire cluster.

180
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,740
The next one that we're also going to disable is we're going to disable the auto-update.

181
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,240
This is the same principle as the plugins.

182
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,280
We don't want to accidentally click the update button, and then we have one Docker container

183
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,080
that is updated, and the rest of them are outdated.

184
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,040
That can cause some serious issues.

185
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,760
The next one that we also want to disable is the general settings administration.

186
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,040
This is things where you'd set, for example, your trusted host names, things like that.

187
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,800
We don't want to be editing the config file through the UI.

188
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,720
Whenever we do that, we want to be editing the file that is set up in our shared network

189
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
location.

190
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,080
All right, now that that is done, we'll hit Control-O and enter to save, Control-X to

191
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,400
exit.

192
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,600
Once that is done, we're just going to change the owner of that file to make sure that we

193
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,280
don't run into any permissions issue further down the road.

194
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,960
Now that that is done, we're going to switch over to our terminal or to our SSH section,

195
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,200
and we're going to run a Docker commit command.

196
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,080
This is simply a Docker commit, Tomo.

197
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,800
This is the name of the container that is currently running, and then this is the name

198
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,760
of the Docker image that we're committing the changes to.

199
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,800
In this case, we'll just give it a name, something like Tomo Premium.

200
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,000
That should take just a second.

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,800
All right, now we have our Docker image configured and set up with all of the code base files

202
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,760
that we need, as well as our geolocation database for Tomo.

203
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:30,000
We will switch back to our Portainer, go to the containers, and we can now shut down this

204
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,400
running Tomo Docker container.

205
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,640
Now when we start up the new container, we'll be using the brand new container that we've

206
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,920
just made all the changes to.

207
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,520
So I went and skipped a bit of a step there, but if we go have a look at the images over

208
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,480
here, you'll see that we now have a new image named Tomo Premium.

209
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,500
So this is a locally stored image.

210
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,240
If you wanted to deploy this to different servers, what you'd need to do is you'd

211
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,800
need to copy that image file.

212
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,640
If you're using Portainer, you can select the box over here, and you can click Export,

213
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,800
and that will export that container image, and you can use that to copy onto your different

214
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,540
servers that are running Docker.

215
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,360
If you have a private Docker repository or Docker image repository, you can also upload

216
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,160
that there so that you can make it a little bit easier for your deployments.

217
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,240
So we'll go back to those containers over there, and we'll add a new container.

218
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,200
So we'll give it a name that's different to the one that's already running, so we'll

219
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,800
just keep it consistent and go for Tomo Premium.

220
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,360
Also change to advanced mode over here, because we're not using an image from a Docker repository,

221
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,160
we want to use the local image.

222
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:48,840
So we'll name that one Tomo Premium as well, add the tag there for latest.

223
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,080
Now we'll scroll down here to the bottom for the volumes.

224
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,980
Now we want to mount two different volumes.

225
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,880
One of those volumes is going to be our config file, so this is going to be exactly the same

226
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,640
way that we set it up previously.

227
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,320
This is the config file in the source folder, and this is the location of the config file

228
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,960
on the NFS share.

229
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,920
And the second file that we want to set up on the network share is the user folder.

230
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,360
This is the one that contains all of our user custom images and fabricants and things like

231
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,160
that.

232
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:32,800
And this example, we'll set it up on host and we'll hit deploy container.

233
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,680
Shouldn't take too long to deploy, so that's done.

234
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,640
We can hit refresh on our page over here just to see if the Tomo server is up and running.

235
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,400
Great, so that's all working perfectly.

236
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,400
So what we're going to do again is we're going to execute into the container, but this time

237
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,720
we're going to connect as a different user.

238
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,560
We want to connect as the www data user.

239
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,200
It's important that whenever we execute any commands on the Docker container or any Tomo

240
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,880
server in general, that if we're executing a console command or if we're changing files,

241
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,320
we need to do it as the correct user, otherwise we could face some pretty nasty permissions

242
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,800
issues.

243
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,800
So the first command that we're going to do is we're going to be setting our license key

244
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,400
for the Tomo marketplace so that we can activate all of our plugins.

245
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,040
So we'll run that one and right, great, that's all set up.

246
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,760
And now it comes to a fairly important part about a multi-server setup for Tomo and that

247
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,440
is how to activate a plugin in a multi-server environment.

248
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,320
As I mentioned earlier on, you can't just activate a plugin through the UI, so it has

249
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,560
to be done through the console command.

250
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,760
Now the benefit of going through all the steps that we've just gone through for setting up

251
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,920
the container, we make sure that all of our plugin files are consistent between all of

252
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
the different servers.

253
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,680
We have our config file synchronized, so when we have all of that ready and we want to activate

254
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,920
that new plugin, we can just run that console plugin activate command.

255
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,820
So this one specifically, it's a short little script that we're just going to execute directly

256
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,640
in the console.

257
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,360
So this is just going to go through that list of plugins that we had set up earlier that

258
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,800
was downloaded and activate them.

259
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,840
There's a couple of other plugins such as the Tag Manager plugin that we want to make

260
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:38,400
sure is active because it might not be activated by default in Tomo server.

261
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,600
Right, that's running now.

262
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,160
So this is a good point to really talk about how important it is to keep this synchronized.

263
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,720
That's kind of the most important thing that if you don't take anything else away from

264
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,200
this talk, the most important thing to understand for a multi-server environment is that we

265
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,160
need to have same code base synchronized across all of the different servers.

266
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,080
Because we're connecting to the same database in the backend, if we have servers that are

267
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,640
differently configured or they have different plugins and they try to activate them and

268
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,600
deactivate them, we can very quickly run into some major issues.

269
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,160
And the problem with those sorts of issues is they usually show themselves in the form

270
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:29,040
of lost data or serious issues when you try to connect or pull reports from your instance

271
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,240
or track some data.

272
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,840
Things are just not going to go right.

273
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:50,640
So we'll give it another minute over here to activate the plugins.

274
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,680
If you're doing this on an existing Tomo server, it can take quite a bit of time.

275
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,640
The larger the database is, the longer it's going to take to activate new plugins.

276
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,000
The reason for that is that it often has to make some schema changes to some of the existing

277
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,440
tables and it's also makes some links, some farm keys, primary keys, things like that.

278
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:19,440
That in a lot of cases, if you have a very large database, it just takes a lot of time.

279
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,920
Should be the last one there.

280
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,080
Great.

281
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
That is the last one in our list.

282
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,760
So we'll go back to the Tomo dashboard over here and we'll just make sure that everything

283
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
is working.

284
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,520
We don't have any issues.

285
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,800
Also go to our settings and have a look at all of the plugins or some of the plugins

286
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
that we've configured.

287
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,560
Are they set up correctly in the back end of Tomo?

288
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,560
All right, great.

289
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,040
So we've got our search performance over here.

290
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,520
We have some other options as well.

291
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,800
All right, great.

292
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,960
So this looks like everything is set up correctly.

293
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,640
Thank you so much for joining us today.

294
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
It's really great for you guys to have joined us.

295
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,800
I will be sticking around in the chat afterwards as well if you guys have any questions for

296
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
me.

297
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You're more than welcome to ask.

298
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,120
You're also more than welcome to, if you're watching or recording this, send us an email

299
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,040
over to support at matomo.org and just mention that you'd like to chat to Richard and I'm

300
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,320
sure he'll be able to get to some of those emails at some point in the future.

301
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,440
Hope you guys have a great MatomoCamp further.

302
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:58,160
Bye.
