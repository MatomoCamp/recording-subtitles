1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
Okay, so we are live now.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,440
So once again, Marco, thank you for joining us today.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,120
To everyone who is attending this session, Marco is one of the co-founders of Plausible

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Analytics.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:28,320
In this talk, he will talk more about the platform, which is a simple, lightweight, open-source

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,840
and privacy-first web analytics tool.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,720
Marco will introduce Plausible, explain the differences from Matomo, and do a demo of

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
the dashboard.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,680
Marco, I'm leaving the floor to you.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
Thank you.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Great.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,880
Well, thanks very much for the intro, and thanks for the invite.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,800
You know, I got an email from one of your colleagues a few weeks ago, and he's like,

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,840
would you like to come and speak on a MatomoCam conference?

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,160
And I was like, but we're Plausible, we're not like even a fork of Matomo, we're completely

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,560
different, like we're an alternative, why would you want us?

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,760
And he was like, oh, we spoke with the Matomo people, and we really insist that you guys

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
should join.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,580
We invited a few other alternatives as well, it would be nice to kind of expand the knowledge

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,400
kind of in the community and so on, and show some of the other people the other work they're

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,720
doing in kind of the same area.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,080
So here I am.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,400
Like mentioned, I'm the co-founder of Plausible Analytics.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,120
Here's a website, Plausible.io, we started, so like in Matomo is, you know, like I have

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,840
known about Matomo for, you know, I don't know, two decades now.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,320
I think it started a while ago, kind of like Google Analytics did, but we are pretty much

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,960
brand new.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,120
The first line of code was written in 2018, we launched our product in 2019.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:59,280
And here we are today, we have, we are fully open source, so you know, you can, our code

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,120
is out there on GitHub available, so you can inspect it, analyze it, you can download it.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,280
We have a very easy self-hosted version as well, so people can install it on their own

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
servers.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
We have the cloud version, which is kind of what makes it sustainable.

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,680
So you know, if we don't have any investors or anything like that, which means that Plausible

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,520
is basically funded by the subscriptions that our subscribers pay us, that the fees they

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
pay us for the subscriptions.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,000
We have 8,000 plus subscribers at this stage, we are installed on more than 60,000 websites,

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,240
at least our cloud version, the self-hosted version, there's no telemetry or anything,

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,400
so we don't know, but 60,000 plus websites use us, about 2 billion page views per month,

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
we kind of count all across these websites.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,120
And yeah, we're a team of eight, a few months ago, if you ask me, three months ago, we were

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,800
a team of three, so now we're a team of eight, we've grown very fast, kind of similar to

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,240
our growth in general on like how well-known we are, we've kind of grown our team as well

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:13,000
very fast over the last few months, so now we have six full-time developers and two non-developers,

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,480
one of them is me, and we're kind of trying to do our best and have a Google Analytics

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,280
alternative that's a bit, for some people, that's better and easier to use.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,960
So basically, let's have a look on our website, let's have a look at the differences from

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:39,280
Matomo at least, with Matomo we're more similar than we are with Google Analytics, which we

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,200
pretty much have nothing with, so Matomo and I can see, this is the post I wrote a couple

50
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,720
years ago, I can see Matomo was founded in 2007, so that's very, very earlier than us

51
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,560
and it's installed on 1.9% of all the websites currently, but we're like, we just started

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,800
showing on those lists, like built with and so on, we're on 0.1 at this stage, so that's

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,800
one of the big differences, like we're tiny currently, but there are some similarities

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,080
as well, which we don't have with Google Analytics at least, but we have with Matomo, so basically

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:23,760
both teams, both tools are fully open source, us like Matomo, everything is a GitHub, you

56
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,020
can do whatever you want with it, self-host it and so on, we are also developing everything

57
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,320
in open, both of us, so all the code is in there, you can go similar to, like you can

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,520
go on Matomo, you can create issues, start discussions, ask us for like, would you guys

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,520
introduce this or even contribute to the products, everything is there in the open, you can see

60
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,640
how we make decisions, what people think we should build next, people voting and so on,

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,320
and the other one that a lot of people like is the complete control of all the data, so

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,880
similar to Matomo, we don't share your data with anyone, we don't sell it to anyone, we

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,600
don't, unlike Google Analytics, we don't use it for any other purposes, there's no ad business

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,120
here, we have nothing to do with surveillance, capitalism and so on, so basically your data

65
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
is your data, we don't really, we're just here to kind of help you make sense of it

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,320
and help you count it, and then what you do with it is not our business, so basically

67
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,280
if all these things are the same and similar to Matomo, what are the differences from the

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
two?

69
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,520
So one big one that a lot of people like is the simplicity aspect, so basically if you

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,240
look at Matomo, it's, for someone like me that's a marketer, it's pretty much like a

71
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,920
full-blown alternative to Google Analytics, you know, you have hundreds of reports, you

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,800
have all the, you can do, you can track pretty much everything in Matomo as you can do in

73
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Google Analytics, which is not the case for Closable, we have one report, one page, everything

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,920
is there on that one page, there's nothing extra you can do, I will show you in a bit,

75
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,520
but basically they're built without simplicity and ease of view is in mind, which is something

76
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,920
that a lot of people were missing when looking at Google Analytics especially, it's like

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,680
a lot of people are like, you know, having to hire people to explain them or build custom

78
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,160
dashboards for them, having to go to training and so on, like there's no need for any without

79
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,080
the Closable, it's just one simple screen.

80
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,440
That also, the fact that we're so simple and we don't track many things also means that

81
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,280
our script is very lightweight, that's another difference from Matomo and for Google Analytics,

82
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,320
Google Analytics is much more heavier than Matomo, so there's a bigger difference there,

83
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,240
but at least from Matomo's perspective, last time I checked, the script was about 22 kilobytes

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,120
while our script is less than one kilobyte, so there's that little difference in terms

85
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,160
of how much, how fast your site can load or how much electricity you will have to use

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,240
with all the visitors and so on, and then the last one, the other one, the one that's

87
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,560
kind of become more important over the last few years with all these privacy regulations

88
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,120
in mind is that the Closable is built from scratch to be as privacy first as possible,

89
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,120
so the reason we don't have any of the stats and metrics that you can look at is because

90
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,240
we don't track many of those things, and why don't we track them?

91
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,840
Because of privacy first aspects, so there's no cookies, there's no long-term identifiers,

92
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,920
there's no way to track people across different websites, there's no way to track people across

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,800
different devices that they have, so all that is inbuilt in Closable by default, Matomo

94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,080
has them as well, you can, you know, there's steps on the Matomos website which you can

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,680
kind of follow and kind of get something similar to what we have kind of out of the box, but

96
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,720
basically that's one big difference is like we do that for you immediately, and there's

97
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,000
no kind of less privacy version of Closable, you just get what you provide by default.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Okay, so what we can do right now is quickly run through the dashboard itself, we open

99
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,240
all of our own stats, so if you go to our website Closable.io and click on live demo,

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,560
you will be able to see the same stats that I can see as a co-founder of Closable, it's

101
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,920
all there all around, all visitors are on your app out there in the public, and this

102
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,440
is our dashboard, it's this one page that I mentioned before, this is pretty much it,

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
there's nothing else.

104
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,040
At the top, you have the current visitors, which you can click on to get to our like

105
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,720
a real-time report, which is pretty much the same as what you saw previously, but just

106
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,000
for the last 30 minutes, so let's go back to our main report here.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,320
So basically, our normal dashboard is this one, and do you have the live, like a date

108
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,360
picker here, like what I was doing right now, and these numbers, these letters on the right

109
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,400
are our keyboard shortcuts, so say I do D, I will go to today, I do N month to date,

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,000
Y year to date, and so on.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,160
We have these little arrows as well that you can use it then go back and forward depending

112
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,040
on where you were before, so if you're on today, you click on it, you go back to yesterday

113
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,920
and so on.

114
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,200
There is the custom range as well, which is you basically select whatever manual time

115
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,360
period that you want.

116
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,700
Filter as well, like everything that we do further down on the page is also filterable,

117
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,760
so you can get to it here if you prefer, kind of like a quicker way, some people prefer

118
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
it that way.

119
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,560
Then we get to our main chart, the only chart we have, the only graph is this one, we have

120
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,040
four metrics in it for now, unique visitors, total page use, bounce rate, visit duration,

121
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,080
you can actually click on them to get the different metrics displayed on the graph,

122
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,800
you can deselect it all and then you kind of get no graphs, so you get even smaller

123
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,200
dashboard then.

124
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,160
Here on the right is a little download icon, which means that whatever you're looking at

125
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,960
here in the report, you click on it, you get a CSV export with all those reports of your

126
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,360
current view, so right now I'm on today, if I click on it, I just get the today's view,

127
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,480
if I was on month to date or last month or whatever, I will just get those reports then.

128
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,520
So what do we have further down?

129
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,800
Further down on the left, we have top sources, everything that you expect, we use the referral

130
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,240
header to see where your traffic is coming from, you can click on the details button,

131
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,520
then that kind of expands and you can see the bounce rate and visit duration of the

132
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,160
different sources.

133
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,520
You can also even, you can click say GitHub, you can click and then you would, your dashboard

134
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,720
is then filtered by the source GitHub and your dashboard now only shows traffic, you

135
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,860
know, people that arrive to your website from GitHub itself, I'm pressing the escape key

136
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,880
right now to get back to the main view.

137
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,440
Next in the top sources, we also have campaigns, so that's basically all your UTMs, all of

138
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,080
them are there and they kind of support the same, you can click to filter your dashboard

139
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,120
by a specific UTM source and see all the traffic that came to your website from that specific

140
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,760
campaign you've been doing and whatever else they did on your site, again, clicking on

141
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,460
escape to go back to the main view.

142
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:47,240
On the right of top sources, we have top pages, that is all the pages on your website that

143
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,200
your visitors have viewed, again, even there you can click on details, then you can get

144
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,480
page views, bounce rate and time on page metrics as well for all the pages, you can click on

145
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,200
any specific page and then your dashboard is again filtered by that specific page and

146
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,220
now we are only showing the traffic that actually went to this specific slash settings page

147
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,480
on our website.

148
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,800
We also have entry pages reports, that's similar to what previously what we saw in top pages

149
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,200
but now we're just showing the entry pages, so basically the pages that people started

150
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,440
their session with, again, the same, you can click on details or you can then click on

151
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,480
and select a specific page and now your dashboard is filtered only by people that started their

152
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,720
session on this specific page on your website.

153
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,360
Same with exit pages pretty much, now we have the pages that people exit your site from,

154
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,480
if you click on details, you will now also see the exit rate and total number of exits

155
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
similar to what you can do in entry pages where clicking on details gives you total

156
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,280
entrances and visit duration too.

157
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:04,960
So those are the top sections, if we go further down, we have the location report, that gives

158
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:12,400
you a little chart by default, you can click on anything specific in the chart to visit

159
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,240
that specific country, so now the dashboard is filtered only by people that are based

160
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,960
in the U.S. and what happens then is that you can see regions or states in the case

161
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,100
of U.S. and if you go even further, you can see the cities, so people are visiting from,

162
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:40,240
so now I can go countries U.S., state is California and then cities Los Angeles and now I have

163
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,440
three filters up here, which means that what I'm looking at now is the dashboard for October

164
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,660
2022 and I'm only displaying people coming from U.S., California and the city of L.A.,

165
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,160
so now everything you see in the dashboard is just those people.

166
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,000
I can click on the escape button again to get back to the main view, the regions, countries

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and cities work the same way, so when you press on the details button, you can see the

168
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
expanded list of everything else and depending on which you select, you can then see something

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,320
different or some different metrics, such as the percentage of visitors coming from

170
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
that location.

171
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,000
Next up on the right-hand side of countries is devices, we start with the desktop mobile

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
laptop tablet, but then you can click on the browser tab here, so now you can see actually

173
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,040
the browser that people are using, you can actually click on say Chrome and then we have

174
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,560
the different versions of Chrome and now I can click on Chrome 107, so now we are only

175
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,520
seeing the traffic on our website using Chrome version 107.

176
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:57,240
You can go to OS, which is the last tab on the devices report and that then shows operating

177
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,920
systems which works in the same way as we saw with the browser, so I can basically click

178
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:10,040
on Mac and say 1014 and now the dashboard is filtered by those people only and for example

179
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,780
I can say top source is Google, so now we are seeing people that arrive to our website

180
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,660
from Google search results that are using a Mac with a Mac version of 1014, that's basically

181
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,320
what we are seeing now in the whole dashboard.

182
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,760
Next up is the next section is pretty much different from website to website, by default

183
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,720
we don't track any goals, but so when you start using plausible, you can set up any

184
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,400
goals that you want and something that we have set up on our own website right now is

185
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,640
that you can visit, we are tracking people that are visiting our blog, so I can see when

186
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,840
I click on this and now the dashboard is visited by people that have visited the blog and I

187
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,800
can see now the top blog post that people have read during this time period that we

188
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
are looking at.

189
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,600
We are also tracking in the goals, we are also tracking the number of sign ups, so that

190
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,280
basically now shows you the number of trial sign ups on our own website, we are tracking

191
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:16,400
that as one of the goals and now my dashboard is only filtered by the people that actually

192
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,240
signed up for the product.

193
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:26,680
We are also tracking the number of upgrades, so again we are a SaaS startup and our subscribers

194
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,960
is basically what funds us because we have no investors, so we are now tracking how many

195
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,880
people are actually joining the platform and finding it interesting enough, valuable enough

196
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:43,560
to pay for it, so now we can see the number of sign ups in October 2022, which is 565,

197
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,520
so that we track too and the last one we track is newsletter sign ups, so on some of our

198
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,000
blog posts we have a newsletter link, so some people choose to subscribe to that and get

199
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,600
the latest blog post sent via email, but this like I mentioned will be empty when you sign

200
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,040
up and what happens is that you can create what you want from it.

201
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:13,080
So what we can do is go to our documentation and in the documentation section there is

202
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:19,360
the goal conversion section, which basically explains what that section does and what we

203
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,480
do have, we have page view goals, kind of similar to our goals for the blog visitors,

204
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,880
like you can combine different dynamically created pages, for example the e-commerce

205
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,800
check out pages and so on and create a page view goal for them, they have custom events

206
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,580
and that basically is everything such as what we do for trial sign ups and subscriptions,

207
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,280
you can track any individual element on your website using that and then after getting

208
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,520
a lot of feedback from people, we decided to create some very simple ones that you can

209
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,800
kind of automatically use, so basically we have very easy way to count outbound link

210
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,840
clicks, so any clicks on your external links, we do the same for file downloads, so we can

211
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,680
easily count the number of clicks on PDF file and so on, same for your 404 error pages,

212
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,720
so you can easily install it, so Plausible just automatically counts visits on 404 pages,

213
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,320
we can do the same for clogged and fielded links and people that use pretty links in

214
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,920
general, we can track those too.

215
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
This is pretty much the view of what Plausible does, it's in the filter, you can kind of

216
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,320
do a couple of different things that you cannot really do in the rest of the dashboard, so

217
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:40,960
say we go filter by page, you can actually select is not, so say I can go filter by page

218
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,000
is not slash sites, so now we're watching the dashboard, people that have not visited

219
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,940
the slash sites page, that's what we're seeing right now, this filter also has the contains,

220
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,520
so we can say okay, let's show everything that contains blog, and so we will go, and

221
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:09,560
now we're showing all the pages that contain the word blog in their URLs, this works the

222
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,880
same way for say locations and all the other metrics, so we can go country is not, and

223
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,840
then we can go say United States and say filter, and now we're showing the dashboard of everyone

224
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,560
except for visitors from the U.S., and then all the metrics that we discussed are now

225
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,040
showing only those that are not from the U.S., and you can go, again, you can add anything

226
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,440
else you want at the same time, so adding this trip means that we now are showing the

227
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,480
dashboard of people that are not from U.S., that are using Mac, and that arrived to our

228
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,240
website from GitHub as the referral source.

229
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,360
You can press the escape key again, and now we're back to the main view, press D, I'm

230
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,240
back on today, I can see today this is our traffic for the day, and that's pretty much

231
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,440
the demo of Plausible, like I mentioned, we really focus on simplicity, ease of use, so

232
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,800
you don't need to have any kind of training to use Plausible, and really on privacy aspects,

233
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,120
which means that we're kind of limited in what we can track, because that's how we want

234
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,520
to build the tool, if we want it to be privacy first, which also helps us being very lightweight,

235
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,960
so our goal is always to keep the script that you insert into your site at less than one

236
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,880
kilobyte, which we currently are at, and hopefully that can continue for a long time.

237
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,920
Yeah, so this is my brief overview of what Plausible does.

238
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:49,400
I don't know if there's any questions from the audience, or anything else I can answer,

239
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:58,440
that we can do now.

240
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:07,520
So there have been some questions in the chat, which I'm also pasting here.

241
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:16,680
So Jochaim asks, Plausible tracks information about display size, but this isn't allowed

242
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:24,920
under German law, TTDSG, did you plan to disable this by option?

243
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:32,160
Yeah, there's actually on our GitHub, in the pull request, there's a pull request that's

244
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,760
actually, right now we're taking the device sizes from the browser screen, like the browser

245
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:45,960
window, but there is a pull request that is suggested that we change that to use the user

246
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,600
agent instead, so that's something that's in works in their own GitHub, and that's something

247
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,360
that we plan to change in the future.

248
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,560
Right now basically, the way it's shown right now, it's like if I visit a website, and if

249
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:10,080
I change my browser to be smaller, I might fit into a mobile, say even though I'm on

250
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,400
a desktop, so that's because we're using the browser as the way to decide what screen size

251
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,480
you're on.

252
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,000
This was made because early on there was a lot of designers that wanted to use Plausible,

253
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,440
and the reason was that they preferred to know what browser width people are viewing

254
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,720
their site on, they don't care as much about the device itself, the size, they care about

255
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,960
more like, are they viewing it to like half screen or full screen and so on, and this

256
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,040
is how it's built until now.

257
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,120
Okay, awesome.

258
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:53,960
Another question was, did you plan to include MTM campaign keywords for tracking?

259
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,240
This would be great to compare with Matomo tracking.

260
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,560
No, nobody has asked for this feature before, so it's not something that's on our radar

261
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
currently.

262
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:14,320
We just use UTM tags for now, but you know, like everything else that we do, when people

263
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,520
come to our GitHub and add a feature request saying, oh, you guys should add this and kind

264
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,800
of tell us the explanation why and send us a link or two, then if enough people upvote

265
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:32,320
it in our forum, they're on GitHub, then that will automatically be placed more prominently

266
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,520
in our own product backlog, so then our developers then are looking like, what's next thing to

267
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
build?

268
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,200
We can rank those feature requests by popularity, by upvotes, and we're like, okay, this is

269
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,720
now number two feature that we're missing to the second most popular, and that will

270
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,120
automatically mean that we will put it higher up our list as well and we will build it faster.

271
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,120
So everything is kind of until now has been done in that way.

272
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,520
We listen to the audience, to what people tell us, and kind of the upvoting and kind

273
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,360
of what's more popular, we try to build that next.

274
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,200
Okay, awesome, somebody's still typing on the chat.

275
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,320
Okay, we have it.

276
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:33,800
Do you get blocked as malware or add blockers by Avast, by Microsoft Edge, et cetera?

277
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Not the malware.

278
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,620
Not from what I've, I have not heard this reported.

279
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,080
What does happen is that we do get blocked by ad blockers.

280
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:50,600
So like if you're using, say, uBlock Origin on Firefox, by default, I think easy primacy

281
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,200
list would include plausible.io as a domain name to block, and they will also include

282
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,080
things such as plausible.js to block, pretty much similar to what happens to Matomos.

283
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:10,120
So that is what happens because ad blockers have decided to block every tracking script,

284
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,280
good or bad, or less privacy, more privacy, they block them all.

285
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,920
And we're kind of putting that category.

286
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:23,320
So Matomo will be blocked, GA will be blocked, Plus will be blocked too.

287
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:32,800
On our docs, we have something that we call a proxy, and that allows you to actually,

288
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:40,400
for those people that want to, we basically, we're very upfront about this, we tell people,

289
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,580
you can use our default script, but that means that you, it will be blocked by people that

290
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,520
use ad blockers, and in our own testing, between six and 26% of people are blocking scripts

291
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,040
by using ad blockers.

292
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,040
And then you just know that, okay, I'm using default script, but maybe I'm not getting

293
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,240
100% of the visitors, but that's also the case for Matomo, Google Analytics, and everyone

294
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,000
else, so I'm blocking that.

295
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,320
But then we've also said, are you concerned about this?

296
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,520
Would you actually try to track something more accurately?

297
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,580
And then we provided the option to do a proxy.

298
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,760
So basically, you will be running plausible from your own domain name, which means then

299
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,200
that the fact that our domain name is blocked on block lists would mean that your domain

300
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,540
is not blocked, and you will be able to count also people that use ad blockers.

301
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:39,400
So basically, I've asked Microsoft question, I've never heard that that will be blocked

302
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,640
by malware, so that's not the case, but definitely ad blockers themselves, they're more the ones

303
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,200
that you would use in browsers, such as uBlock Origin, I don't know the other names, but

304
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,200
basically they would be, some of them at least, will be blocking our domain name and our script,

305
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:01,920
which means that those visitors won't be counted by default.

306
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:14,120
Okay, let's just wait one more minute if somebody else wants to drop question.

307
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Sure.

308
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:33,080
In general, for a lot of questions there, they'll be answered in our docs.

309
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,760
So that's what I've been using a couple of times during this presentation.

310
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,600
But basically everything will be in there, such as, you know, if you want to invite your

311
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,320
team members, assigned roles, we have a section in the docs, you know, how you can do that,

312
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,080
you know, how you can embed your dashboard on another website using the iframe.

313
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,040
So that will be there, you know, instructions for that as well.

314
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,320
So basically, we've tried to build a lot of these useful features that people have asked

315
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,800
us for, and they're part of the docs and part of your site settings when you log into your

316
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
account.

317
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,720
You know, for example, one interesting thing is that you can open up your stats to the

318
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
public.

319
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,840
So similar to what we've done on our own website, you can do the same for you.

320
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,480
You can actually, with one click, you'll be able to set your...

321
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,320
So I'm going to go into the site settings here to actually show how that works.

322
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,220
But basically, with one click, I can enable my stats to be shown in public.

323
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,760
So basically, that's a cool little feature.

324
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,440
Basically, we have another thing is the Search Console integration.

325
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,800
So you could integrate plausible with Search Console.

326
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,760
So when you go to your dashboard, then what you see on the Google, if you actually click

327
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,800
on Google, in your top sources, and you go to a longer time period where Google has data

328
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,080
or you will then be able to see what search terms people arrive to your site with.

329
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,120
But basically, there's a lot of these kind of additional features we have, and they will

330
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,080
be documented in the docs.

331
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,200
We have our trial.

332
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,080
There's a free trial of 30 days if people are interested.

333
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,720
There's also the, obviously, completely free as in beer, self-hosted version people can

334
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
install.

335
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,560
Recently, one of the big things was that people asked us for Google Analytics import.

336
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,440
We didn't have it a few months ago, but we ended up spending, I think, more than six

337
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,280
months of development time.

338
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,680
And now it's online.

339
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,440
So basically, if you're one of those that wants to escape from Google Analytics these

340
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,040
days, especially ahead of Universal Analytics being shut down, I think June, July next year,

341
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,360
there's now a way to do that and import your data into plausible because Google doesn't

342
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,000
allow you to import the data into GA4.

343
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,480
Yeah, so that's basically we have the APIs.

344
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,160
Another thing that's not kind of prominent in the dashboard itself is that you have the

345
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,320
States API, which allows you to take any of the stats programmatically.

346
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,200
We have the Events API.

347
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,280
So say you want to use Plasmo without JavaScript or you want to track your mobile apps, you

348
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,040
can do that through the Events API or the Sites API, which allows you to add sites,

349
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,200
delete sites, create goals, all that kind of stuff just programmatically.

350
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:37,040
So for example, several SaaS businesses are using plausible as their web analyst provider.

351
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,040
So then they will be using things such as Sites API to create websites for the clients.

352
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,560
Then they will create these shared dashboards that they can embed on their sites in their

353
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,520
own UI or they're using the Sites API where they can take individual metrics and place

354
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,920
them directly in their UI.

355
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,960
So they can, if they don't want to show our default dashboard as it is, they're just going

356
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,000
to, okay, I'm just going to show the number of visitors in this part of my UI or I want

357
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,480
to show the top pages here.

358
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,600
They can do that through the Sites API itself.

359
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,680
Another maybe another thing to mention, the recent change that we did is all those European

360
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,800
countries that have said that Google is illegal because of them being a US owned company and

361
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,640
using US owned cloud infrastructure, plausible, at least the plausible IO version, which we

362
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,440
run in the managed hosting, it's fully European owned and we only exclusively use European

363
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,940
owned infrastructure.

364
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,960
So that will mean Hezner and Bunny rather than AWS or whatever else people are using.

365
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,200
So that's another kind of feature, I guess we can say, in plausible that may not be there

366
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,680
in some other tools.

367
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,560
Awesome.

368
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,760
