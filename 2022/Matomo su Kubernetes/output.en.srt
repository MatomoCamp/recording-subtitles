1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi Massimo, can you hear me?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Perfect, thanks Ronan.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's play the video you sent us and then we'll take all the questions we receive on the chat.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Would you like to do it in another way?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Perfect, thank you.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Greetings and thanks for taking the invitation to follow this session in Italian.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Massimo Campone and I have been working professionally in IT since 1990.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Since 1996 I have been focused on the Internet. In these decades I have accumulated experiences very different from the development of management to entrepreneurship, to systemic management in small and medium-sized enterprises.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am pleased to support the spread of software that enters the name FOSS, Free Open Source Software, with public code and maintained by the community and without direct license costs.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All this demo has been recorded and edited with free Open Source tools, therefore projects like Matomo.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Matomo offers the possibility of doing web tracking without the data being ceded to third parties.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In addition, the same data can be ceded in Europe and therefore meet the requirements requested by privacy and GDPR regulations.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:51,000
In the non-premise version that we see today, it is assured that no other subject can have access to our data, as well as the ability to anonymize them to ensure an absence of profiling outside of statistical use.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to underline that there are many ways to reach the same installation, configuration and maintenance goal of a service platform,

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
which depend on the dimensions to be faced and from the logistics inside the company, for example if there are developers who use DevOps methodology for managing the CI-CD chain.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It is obvious that a systemist does not need a demo like this to be able to install, it certainly does better than me.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Exactly the destination of this short encounter, which I underline is not a course but a pretext to suggest and start the use of Matomo in a production platform, like that of Service Manager Kubernetes,

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but which remains scalable and can face a production level.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I would like to bring the audience of small and medium-sized companies closer, which in Italy are the largest percentage,

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
so the agencies and companies that want to return in possession of their own autonomy on tracking, as well as to disconnect from the large commercial groups

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and return to the requirements of the requests for tracking in Italy and the European regulations.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All this then to increase the cable diffusion in the adoption towards the low of Matomo.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have therefore chosen a mix between graphic interface and command line to be able to introduce the service functions of the cloud providers at the didactic level.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
All scripted, so as to constitute integrity of the images and the correlations between the services.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Probably many of you have already tried the server version, or even tried to run the images for Docker Container,

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and are interested in the next step, that is, distribution from an orchestrator for the need for a price-performance ratio.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Managing many sites to be able to face scalability and Kubernetes is the solution.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We will see the installation then on managed services of the platform and services formula,

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
so as not to load us in the management of the orchestrator service itself.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The level of access to understanding is to know the principles of operation of the distribution of applications through images Container.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's start from the Matomo site, then,

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to which you can provide free cloud service on European servers and with costs in resorts.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It starts from 19 euros per month for 30 websites on 50,000 hits, which are SEO events,

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
therefore not HTTP hits, which are instead the objects that transit for the construction of web pages.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So it's about link page, link download, set search, this type of events.

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
50,000 hits, which roughly correspond to 17,000 visitors per month on 30 sites.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then, of course, there are different packages, and as hits grow, the formula is increasingly economically more advantageous.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Meanwhile, today we see the Unpremise version, that is, it can be installed for free,

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but with some Canon plugins, including the updates themselves.

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There is still a good base totally free.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I remind you that today we will not see the product, but its ability to be distributed on cloud provider,

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:13,000
bringing us exclusively to the installation phase, exclusive, I repeat, then the following configuration steps to put it in place,

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
there would not have been even the time available.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Installation on the server, the product has a malfunction management panel,

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and size to correct, to best meet the performance.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Find guides, documentation, videos, community,

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and even if it is not mentioned, a last search on github to find the developers,

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
many tips and codes ready.

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We see the two parts of the demo,

50
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
then the creation of a Kubernetes cluster on two cloud providers completely different,

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I chose them precisely for the different offer size,

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
very different from them, obviously at completely different costs, services and potential.

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Also note the debt formulas, which are very different,

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
for example on Azure it is possible to allocate the resources of the cluster

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
without destroying it, and this will not lead to debts while staying.

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
On DigitalOcean you have to destroy it to abolish debts.

57
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
DigitalOcean, which today presents a good base of cloud services,

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
there are servers called droplets, droplet, backup and snapshot services,

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
database and access through CLI, command line, interface,

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
owner to services and configurations, functions and apps, metrics a little on everything,

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
a marketplace with third-party integration and also the API.

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's start immediately with creating the cluster,

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
choosing in which region to position the machines,

64
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
obviously we choose the European ones to be adherent to the GDPR requests,

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the number of nodes and dimensions are obviously changeable,

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
there is the option Autoscale for the automatic horizontal requirement from requests,

67
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
in production I recommend this,

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
being able to enlarge the maximum number of nodes to your liking,

69
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the option High availability to ask for app time at 99.95%

70
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and at the time of this registration, still in beta, Legend for the database.

71
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Ok, we give a name, position it in a project to find it and launch the Deploy.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This operation lasts a few minutes,

73
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
so I interrupt the registration and resume as soon as it is completed.

74
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
After a while, the resources for the node pool are already visible,

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I close tips and recommendations,

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
we are curious about the marketplace reserved for the third-party resources for Kubernetes,

77
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we are interested in how it works,

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
we are interested in how it works,

79
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we are interested in how it works,

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we are interested in how it works,

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and also the third party Kubernetes,

82
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
some cluster settings,

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
obviously, we recommend modifying only via client kubecontrol,

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
the liexама updates that we recommend letting run automatically.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
turns on a cluster, we can download the configuration file,

86
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
First operation, we install the portable Meet control site

87
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,320
called Doctl, then Digital Ocean Control, available on all the main

88
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,560
operating system architectures. The documentation is available, it allows us to read

89
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,920
all the sequence of necessary operations. We then create the apyToken,

90
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,280
name and duration, and we install kubecontrol by adding it to the system part

91
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,440
of our client. Once these operations are done, we can use the shell on our

92
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:26,640
client to access the cluster. For the tutorial I download the configuration file,

93
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,160
this is the token, I'm not worrying about hiding these codes because the

94
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,880
cluster has already been destroyed at the end of this registration.

95
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,400
Ok, we connect to the cluster and these are the nodes.

96
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,800
This is the list of the client Kubernetes contexts, there are several

97
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,080
tests that I have done previously of already destroyed clusters, you can

98
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,840
always eliminate what you do not need. We make sure that the current one is

99
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,800
the right one, oops, error in the response of the interface, I repeat for clarity.

100
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,720
Now, before proceeding with the installation, I want to present you an

101
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,320
application dashboard, that is, a panel for the installation of Kubernetes applications,

102
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,600
which is kubeapp. Another open source software, this is WMWare, a subsidiary of Dell. You can

103
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,360
install it on any cluster to be able to have a web management interface

104
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,680
of the applications. Both to be able to install kubeapp and other applications,

105
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,600
but in command line we use Helm, which is available both as a package manager,

106
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,400
such as Chocolatay, Homebrew, Snap or by downloading the binary, as we are now,

107
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,480
skipping its resource on the github, to be able to be curious about the

108
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,600
features of the latest updates. Once this is done, we can proceed to

109
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:01,960
add the bitnami repository, on which then we come back with that to install kubeapp.

110
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Just for curiosity, we move for a moment to another Kubernetes cluster, where I already have

111
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,920
the installation of kubeapp and launch the port forward to be able to redirect the

112
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,720
remote server to my local port. On this other cluster I already have a matomo

113
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,880
that is running, in addition to an ingress and gx controller and a platform for

114
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:35,720
the local code, such as Red, based on a Node.js. The bitnami repository is very wide and gives us

115
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,760
access to updated images in configurations that already implement a

116
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:48,640
good level of security. We will use just a matomo managed by bitnami.

117
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,000
Since we are in the web interface, for the management, for those who do not know it, I recommend

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,680
portainer, of which I am enthusiastic. Very comfortable both for images and container docker,

119
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,240
both local and remote, which precisely for the management of Kubernetes cluster.

120
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Always this other cluster, here is the kubeapp that we saw a while ago, and obviously the

121
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:44,400
unmissable matomo. I hope I have provided some useful information and let's go back to our

122
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,480
installation. A nice update of the repositories to ensure we have the latest

123
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,320
updates and proceed. Unfortunately I am not in an area with high coverage and 4G signal,

124
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,840
so here is the possible error in theme, but it does not matter, it does not concern us

125
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,960
something that will interest us at the moment.

126
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:17,480
Ok, elm install matomo. Let's go immediately launch the cluster management shortcut and check the

127
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:46,760
deploys in action. Officially it is finished and in the post there is a message for the

128
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,440
free assets like me, that is, even if everything has been launched, it is not said that it has already

129
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:00,000
finished and therefore you have to wait patiently for a moment. The application username and the

130
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,560
password are notified in the meantime. Since I have my Windows station, I do not have the utility base of 64,

131
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:18,640
so I remove it and in the meantime we can have access to the decrypted password. So for

132
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:31,080
didactic we can also go to decrypt online. In the meantime it is all on foot. On the

133
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,920
cloud provider shortcut we check. Here is the last process that is updated and we finally have the

134
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:47,160
load balancer that exposes the resource on a public IP. We open browser, password and finally we enter.

135
00:14:47,160 --> 00:15:01,560
At this point we are suggested the code to be implemented for the tracking, but note that

136
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,720
an IP is the one that directs to the server, so we have to take care of the resolution of the name.

137
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:19,480
Let's go back to the DigitalOcean shortcut where I am managing the DNS record and we are going to update the record.

138
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,400
Comfortably, the interface is offered the possibility of selecting from the available

139
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,720
resources. Only now that we have the load balancer pointed by a record, we can

140
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,760
create the certificate for the HTTPS exposure. Here too there are many ways to get the

141
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,320
same result, we see the more didactic one, even if it is a bit vanilla. So we use very comfortable

142
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,560
the DigitalOcean interface that allows us to manage the creation of the certificate using the

143
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:03,120
command line. I always remember that the API access operation and the web interface are also available.

144
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,080
Obviously we can import a certificate of our own purchased from other channels with a

145
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,600
higher level of tracking than the one created using the encrypted service. We close the certificate,

146
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:23,600
we check that the resolution has been verified and we capture the ID. We always go

147
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,120
didactically and manually to modify on the load balancer also the other annotations below are

148
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,400
not necessary. Obviously this is a demo approach, the correct one instead asks for a service

149
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,480
such as ChartManager that takes care of the request and distributes the certified cluster

150
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,920
requests of the various issuers and load balancer and that allows you to integrate the entire

151
00:16:45,920 --> 00:17:13,920
relational service cluster into the YAML file that the Deploy allows. At this point

152
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,400
we receive a response bad request and the reason is that we are working without a

153
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,120
ChartManager or another service that is assimilable, so another certificate is missing

154
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,960
to the pod that is running with the web server. Also here we act with an ECNON recommended

155
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,320
in production. We simply go to use HTTP to access the port and it guarantees

156
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:44,360
that an answer returns to the load balancer. This time we look for the password in

157
00:17:44,360 --> 00:18:05,720
Secrets where it is unclear. Now we can proceed with a trivial action of integration

158
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,200
of the code necessary for tracking in a page. Let's go then to recover the code

159
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,920
from javascript for retracking, now updated with the name of the domain and update the

160
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:42,240
source of the web page and reload.

161
00:18:45,920 --> 00:19:00,720
Here we are in the control panel of the pages in real time and we check the tracking.

162
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:18,240
Matomo offers a very useful management panel to control the functional setting of

163
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,680
performance. In the demo just installed are already present the recommendations to

164
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,640
solve, but as I said the configuration is not the subject of this summary exhibition.

165
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,800
Very important is the mechanism of building the funds, the statistical values ​​that for

166
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,200
a modesto site are executed at the moment the dashboard is interrogated and they are solved

167
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,880
in a few seconds, but for sites that have high traffic, Matomo would cost the

168
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,000
reconstruction of each opening of the statistical panel, which would require many resources

169
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,160
continuously. But then implemented a cron job that follows at regular intervals

170
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,760
like every hour or less depending on the frequency of graphics visualization and of importance

171
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,040
that are updated for the social media manager who is using them.

172
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,560
Another very interesting tool for the administrators is that both Matomo and the plugins are updated

173
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,160
very easily and semi-automatically. The admin receives an email with a link to

174
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,160
perform the update, I found it very comfortable even when in motion.

175
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,080
There is a nice assortment of plugins already included and free, while in marketplace

176
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,840
there are further plugins that can provide an annual canon, which in this case

177
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,680
includes its updates. Many also offer the test period.

178
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Very comfortable are the Matomo APIs that allow you to control the management environment

179
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,040
or external events that can be customized with any language.

180
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,000
A few weeks ago, for example, I published on LinkedIn a demo of a endpoint that allows

181
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,480
you to add your own connection to the filters so as not to pollute the statistics, even

182
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,560
if you are in mobility, using the code red based on Node.js.

183
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,080
The demo ends here. I hope I have given enough elements to be able to create

184
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,840
interests and stimulate the adoption of Kubernetes in production environments for Matomo.

185
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,600
An orchestrator allows you to dynamically scale the number of nodes on which to distribute

186
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,200
Matomo pods and to be able to absorb very high traffic peaks, although temporary,

187
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,320
and to be able to save when the management numbers have gone down.

188
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,360
And a demo of introduction, many elements are missing, there would have been no time

189
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,040
to be able to see them all and the training is not even the purpose of this video.

190
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,880
I hope it is only the starting point with which a community in the Italian language can

191
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,160
start by sharing their experiences and the complete configuration files also for

192
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,280
other cloud providers, with servers in Europe, and push so that Matomo is adopted

193
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,440
in the various templates and marketplaces. I will be happy to be able to participate

194
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,960
with my own experience. If you want, you can contact me at the email in superimpression

195
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,880
or connect with me on LinkedIn to stay in touch.

196
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,680
Good tracking and autonomy, see you on the net.

197
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:14,400
Wow, thank you very much Massimo for this historical moment, I would say, because as I have already

198
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:26,240
announced on the social network, it is the first time that we have a 100% conference in Italian.

199
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:37,000
In fact, last year we had the pleasure of receiving the team from the region of

200
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,160
Emilia-Romagna, the talk was in English and this time it is really the first time that we have it

201
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:56,600
in the fourth language of Matomo Campo, then Italian, then English, German and French,

202
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,480
so I don't know if Massimo can hear me. Yes, yes, perfectly, thank you.

203
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:15,080
Yes, I would also like to thank you because you did all this work of recording the video

204
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:24,120
to ensure that the conference will be of quality and that there will be no problems in the explanations

205
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:32,640
that you are going to give, so unfortunately, as you know, I don't know much about the

206
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:40,000
configuration of the servers, so the question that I am asking you now, which is really about

207
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:53,600
what no one knows, so I know Docker and I understand the need to use Docker,

208
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:03,920
but I am not the first person to say that I have it in a very professional way,

209
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:11,200
that in fact uses Kubernetes and I don't understand the difference between using Docker

210
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:20,280
and using Kubernetes, I don't understand anything about Kubernetes, so I'm sorry to ask you

211
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:28,000
this question, but what is the advantage of using Kubernetes to install Matomo?

212
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,920
Yes, you have practically raised the question, I think it is more normal that it can be done,

213
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:44,200
especially for those who have to install and manage an online service such as web tracking,

214
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:56,840
which is a bit of a special service because it needs to adapt the resources that are allocated

215
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,000
for the distribution of the service temporarily, so not in a programmed way. I mean this because,

216
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,320
if there is a web marketing commercial campaign and obviously there is a phase in which,

217
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:20,680
suddenly, also because of a technical aspect of viral marketing, it is not easily predictable,

218
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:28,080
and therefore sites, landing pages suddenly ask for very high resources,

219
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,080
this if it has not been organized before with Docker, the resources have not been allocated,

220
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:42,600
so you can obviously run the risk of not being able to have a service at the same level

221
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:49,280
with the performance. An orchestrator allows you to run Docker images on multiple nodes,

222
00:25:49,280 --> 00:26:00,280
not only, but these nodes can be, as I mentioned, with the Autoscale option that offers

223
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:08,560
the ability of a dynamic adjustment, so by increasing the resources, the orchestrator

224
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:15,240
is concerned with executing the pods, which are the containers, the images that are running on other nodes,

225
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,960
and this also allocates other nodes, so more nodes are allocated horizontally and the pods,

226
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:30,920
therefore the executions are distributed, so as to be able to manage the load. This, since it is dynamic,

227
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,040
this operation also allows you to save, because I can have at my disposal three,

228
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:45,240
four, five nodes, which are machines, servers, as long as it is necessary, then when the numbers

229
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,360
are reshaped, the architecture also reshapes and this allows you to save,

230
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:59,840
because the machines have an average hourly cost, and this is the reason why

231
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,080
an orchestrator is preferred. I don't know if I answered.

232
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:16,240
Okay, I don't know, in fact, I'll give you my answer, which I have understood,

233
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:31,320
so with Docker, in fact, the container is fixed and Kubernetes allows you to orchestrate,

234
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:39,360
so to make the container dynamic, or at least you can, I don't know,

235
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,920
replace it with another container that has more capacity to allow your system to work,

236
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:56,320
so Docker, in fact, only allows you to take a site that has a traffic that is always the same,

237
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:04,400
in which you have already thought that you can do a hundred visits a day,

238
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,320
and in fact the way of Kubernetes, in fact, a security to allow, as you said,

239
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,640
that there is a web marketing company that will bring you, I don't know, two million visits in more,

240
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,280
and that will then destroy your container, and then Kubernetes allows you, in a dynamic way,

241
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,000
to give more resources to the container to allow the site to live with Matomo, is that it?

242
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,760
Yes, and it also obviously guarantees continuous availability of the service,

243
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,800
because all the updates, both the host, so the various nodes in this case,

244
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,960
and the docker, in short, the executions, are always guaranteed,

245
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:59,960
so I can have a node that, for any reason, can be an update or an unavailability,

246
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,680
maybe physical, therefore, or logical, however, the whole service is standing,

247
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,120
and it is always at the maximum of the performance, so the dynamic performance,

248
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,640
we said, are the main point for the need to use an orchestrator

249
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,440
like Kubernetes, because obviously there are also other orchestrators,

250
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,360
so my choice was that of the most widespread system,

251
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,880
the most flexible system, more accessible also for a small company,

252
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,080
this is because it is very widespread on all the cloud, the simplest, most economical thing,

253
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,400
and what I wanted to show with this presentation was just this,

254
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:55,480
that thanks to the distribution of the Matomo images by Bitnami,

255
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,720
as obviously the digitalist charts that have been presented yesterday,

256
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,200
of which I am very interested, in short, I will certainly do some tests,

257
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,120
this allows, let's say, a capacity to be able to install easily,

258
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:18,040
this I want to show, the production environment at a certain level,

259
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:24,720
also as a minimum experience, so without worrying about anything else,

260
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,960
then obviously there is always the possibility of starting,

261
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,600
and clearly putting the methodology in place, to make the necessary experience,

262
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,320
the goal of my demo is in Italian, it was carried out in Italian,

263
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:50,000
just to open up to the small and medium-sized company, let's say, to try to increase the spread.

264
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Ok.

265
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Thank you.

266
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Great, I also have some questions that are not secret, because they are in the chat,

267
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,400
but only for people who are going to watch this video in the future,

268
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,760
it is important for me that I ask you.

269
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:15,440
So another question would be, in Italy, how do the server administrators work?

270
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,960
In fact, do they work with an English or Italian interpreter?

271
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:29,520
Because to tell you the truth, we don't know it very well, in fact, the Italian market,

272
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:40,240
so I want to know if in fact there is the language of work for the server administrators, what is it?

273
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:51,200
Yes, unfortunately, let's say in 30 years I could write a book on the anecdotes of unpleasant things

274
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,720
that I have seen, even in companies of a certain size,

275
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:06,480
we are talking about several hundred cars, unfortunately, let's say, I also find server installations in Italian,

276
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,120
this is not very convenient, because obviously the ability to debug on system messages,

277
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:24,680
errors, logs, etc., is quite complicated, because the translations are obviously not perfectly identical.

278
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:34,520
Personally, I also find it difficult to find in a Windows server the name of the service,

279
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:45,160
because it is not really a thing that I always tell, let's say, a Windows certification exam that I tried in Italian,

280
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,240
so I said, surely I find it easier, now I had to repeat it in English and I passed it right away,

281
00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:00,200
but if not in Italian it was really indecent, unfortunately, let's say, the assortment is very different,

282
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:08,840
the language does not have a degree of social penetration as deep as it happens in other countries,

283
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:16,200
I have also lived abroad, let's say in Italy, English is not spoken, not even in the work environment,

284
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:26,120
let's say, it is rare, it is really rare, that's why I said, to try to expand the target,

285
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:35,480
I preferred to try to do an Italian session, so to see if there is more curiosity and attention.

286
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:46,680
Another question that I did not put in the chat, I thought, according to you, that there was no documentation in Italian,

287
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:54,040
I speak more about the end user documentation, so today when you go to matomo.org,

288
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:03,800
what you see is a 100% documentation in English, they have made translations in French,

289
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:13,400
but I know that, for example, for France it is really a break for a part of the population to go to matomo,

290
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:21,720
and I would like to know if, according to you, it is the same thing in Italy, that there is a big market,

291
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,960
but that in the population in Italy, typically, there is really a documentation in English,

292
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,120
that is not possible, and indeed there is a market that is lost at this moment,

293
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,000
and that matomo cannot go to learn, because the documentation is in English.

294
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:50,360
Look, I'm sorry, because yesterday I was very confused, because there was your presentation on the aspect of translation,

295
00:34:50,360 --> 00:35:00,440
and so, in fact, I can't wait to see it again, because I'm interested if there is a field in which I can collaborate and participate,

296
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,360
with Italian translations, I'm very happy.

297
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:11,800
Surely, let's say, the Italian market is a bit particular from this point of view,

298
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:20,680
just think that even in cinema there is no cinema that comes in language, with subtitles,

299
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:27,720
where you have the ability to appreciate, how to say, the execution of the original actors.

300
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:37,320
Here everything is translated, it is just a typical thing, a typical behavior, a bit anomalous.

301
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:44,680
Surely having a document, of the documentation in Italian, can facilitate this penetration towards the bottom,

302
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:55,560
this horizontal diffusion, here, maybe you can open the project if there is the possibility,

303
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,720
and obviously ask a community to squeeze in, to find themselves, then it is obvious that at a certain level,

304
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:15,640
as Tassimo is saying in the chat, we all work in English, I don't want to see anything in Italian on the machines, etc.,

305
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:24,520
otherwise it is impossible, but maybe it can be an approach, a way to be able to open more horizontally,

306
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
to increase the diffusion a little more.

307
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:34,600
Excellent. In your presentation, we saw that you use Digital Ocean,

308
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:46,200
so I wanted to know if there are services in Italy that, I don't know, that you use, like us in France,

309
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:58,200
certainly we go on Amazon, AWS, there are all these American services that we use,

310
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:05,160
but we also have OVH, we also have, let's say, beautiful companies,

311
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:23,080
I wanted to know if there are Italian companies in Italy that have the power to face, to fight all the United States,

312
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:33,480
and I also wanted to know where the main data centers are in Italy and if there are, from the point of view of the law,

313
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:42,440
if there are obligations to have the data where there is hosting in Italy at 100%.

314
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:53,000
Look, since everything is obviously quite dynamic, I am not very updated, obviously, on the legal aspect,

315
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:02,200
I have remained to the fact that the need is that the servers are in Europe, because we follow the European regulations,

316
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:11,960
indeed, fortunately there is, because it is also faster than the Italian Pachydermic,

317
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,680
which is notoriously very slow, there is a lot of inertia in the reactions,

318
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:27,960
so fortunately, let's say, the European Community has the ability to be faster in meeting the requirements

319
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:38,440
for the emission of the regulations, and this helps us a lot, in short, the server farming,

320
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,920
Italy has a slightly particular geography and therefore has this vertical development,

321
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:53,960
so the point of contact with the continent is obviously Milan, and as far as I remember,

322
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:03,240
I have been working on the network since the early 1990s, when there was no internet, but there was the ITAPAC X25,

323
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,440
for those who remember it, the first network of Pachydermic accounts,

324
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,760
and the first nodes have always been geographically, obviously, in Milan, where there is the MIX,

325
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:22,600
where the main European global hubs converge, then obviously the Italian back in the years

326
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:36,360
has improved, and another important hub is in Rome, where connections converge through the Mediterranean.

327
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:43,720
Server farming has always been, historically, before Milan, and some in Rome,

328
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:53,800
but then there are a couple of cases in central Italy, Marche and Umbria, but nothing spectacular,

329
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:05,480
let's say, the resources in Italy are only for geophysical reasons, just in contact with the continent,

330
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:19,400
and that's about it. Now it's 9.42, so maybe we still have time for one last question,

331
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:28,040
I'm looking in the chat if there's anything, otherwise my question would be that.

332
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:35,880
So the use of Google Analytics has been denied, I would say, or I would say illegal,

333
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,760
from what I understand by looking at the social networks, and I wanted to know if in fact in Italy,

334
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:54,280
companies still take it as a joke, so let's continue to use Google Analytics

335
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:07,480
because the possibility of having a fine is about zero, or really it's a concern of the companies,

336
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:15,240
and so they go to do, I would say, migration, to go to Matomo, or to another solution,

337
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:24,520
or it could also be interesting if there are analytical solutions in Italy that we don't know,

338
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:34,280
I would say, in Europe, which are 100% Italian, that we need to know.

339
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:45,560
Look, you've said the right thing, and unfortunately you've raised an unpleasant issue,

340
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:55,800
because unfortunately, also me, working in collaboration with companies that deal with privacy and GDPR,

341
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,520
I must confess that the situation is dramatic, to say the least.

342
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:09,480
Obviously there is very little interest, very little adherence to the normative aspect,

343
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,600
but there is even in the technical aspect.

344
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:21,240
So the average of the achievements is so low that there would be a lot to work on,

345
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:29,240
I would say, with the necessary cultural literacy,

346
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,320
not only in the capacity of the technology solution,

347
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,760
because obviously it is taken a lot in the background,

348
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:50,200
that of security, that of the capacity to create and distribute a product technologically,

349
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,560
also from the point of view of the law, adequate.

350
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:02,920
Unfortunately, this is the reality, it is useless to hide behind a finger.

351
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:17,000
Let's just say that there is a lot of work to be done when a company starts to have a certain degree of visibility,

352
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,880
and then the exposure is obviously broadened, and then there is really talk of insecurity,

353
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:37,640
as well as of incapacity, because I suppose that companies that are not able,

354
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:43,960
and are not up to it, but not only with the law, but also with technology and with a vision

355
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:52,920
in the capacity to create and distribute services, the problem is fundamentally cultural.

356
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:59,960
I hope that there will be more and more attention.

357
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:11,160
At the time, I am talking about the early 2000s, I had also collaborated with the association of webmasters in Italy, IWA,

358
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:21,400
for what concerns all the capacity to create accessible web content.

359
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:32,920
It was already a struggle not long ago, but in fact, if we look closely at the average of publications, etc.,

360
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:49,400
it is still low-level, there are still improvised graphics that write in yellow on white, so there is still a lot to work on.

361
00:44:49,400 --> 00:45:06,680
Thank you very much, it's 9.47, I looked in the chat and there are no other questions, so once again I would like to thank you for this historical moment,

362
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:24,200
the first conference in Italian, I hope that there will be others in the next Matamocamp editions, thank you very much Massimo.

363
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:30,840
Thank you for the opportunity, thank you also to Lukas who followed us backstage,

364
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:45,640
obviously all the collaborations and participations are very open, let's go inside because there is a lot to do here, also for the quality of the services delivered.

365
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,640
Thank you, thank you all.

366
00:45:47,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Great, thank you very much, see you soon, ciao!
