the european union where we are in

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,280
gdp our country soda general data protection

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,090
regulation

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,940
in effect since twenty eighteen has changed

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,960
some things to be a little on

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,840
the stated in this case andrea looking

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,511
about the public reaction so matomo and

16
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,490
the masses to the people really care

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,430
about gdp our compliance does is one

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,150
of the up

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:57,990
big

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,900
barbecues piste at one of the big

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,720
unique selling points of metal but in

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,650
general it's well in a very big

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,960
letters on the homepage as well dad's

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,980
motto more is a data secure alternative

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,200
to google analytics and two other discuss

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,680
not open but closed source software as

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,190
so

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,240
is this even a good selling point

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,520
in this case so uh what did

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,570
people think about data security about data

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,260
privacy

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,550
so to be his daughter here and

33
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,340
if you can't see the infographics data

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,850
well and we can provide you with

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,640
the presentation afterwards does is no problem

36
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,630
anywhere this here and now

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,830
sorry for not having the exact routes

38
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,800
in any case but we were asking

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,570
some people or in this case as

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,510
the t style did so or how

41
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,730
half the new data protection regulations to

42
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,180
gdp are impacted on your sense of

43
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,900
security

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,950
at the chateau de pere auto sorry

45
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,710
so did anything change after the gdp

46
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,560
r came into effect this was asked

47
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,270
in this case to be exactly in

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,000
sweden so we are in northern europe

49
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,630
and according to the survey seventy five

50
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,110
percent

51
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,360
sat well no difference in any rate

52
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,570
so most of the people well before

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,390
g power and after gdp are no

54
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,170
difference at all

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,920
fourteen percent at least said i feel

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,830
more secure now soda gd per hour

57
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,320
at least for a round or a

58
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,460
sixth person did make a positive difference

59
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,400
and had a positive impact for four

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,250
percent not so much they said i

61
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,440
feel less secure and i

62
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:04,080
was seven percent do not know anything

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,750
about it or didn't care but

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,540
and in this case

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,790
so sorry i had this case so

66
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,120
dumb

67
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,530
majority well didn't think there was a

68
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,140
big difference before and after the gdp

69
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,260
are and at least fourteen fifteen per

70
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,020
cent around worried about i feel more

71
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,330
secure through the gdp are so in

72
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,360
this case most people hat at least

73
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,060
in sweden and it's seen as a

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,480
high

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
having a positive impact so did gdp

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,650
are as a while force of good

77
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,610
if you want to say

78
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,890
but howard's how was it done on

79
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,920
the well more regional or state level

80
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,940
dis case so another survey about gbr

81
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,810
enforcement so the data protection authorities this

82
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,880
case lack of expertise

83
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:07,500
so most public administration and is not

84
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,240
really ready for gdp are enforcement but

85
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,340
run second i've got a question from

86
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,050
ronan have you ever heard of german

87
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,200
citizen suing any websites because of misuse

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,700
of a rep analytic solution

89
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,980
i have come to that in a

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,000
moment of regarding the public authorities in

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,030
this case and you while they aren't

92
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,090
seen as that fit for the digital

93
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,880
digital age in this case mostly because

94
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,760
we have for example in germany rich

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,890
as a to country on the far

96
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,280
left side

97
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,820
site we have around seven hundred people

98
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,240
in personnel doing non technical staff and

99
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,610
only about one hundred so one in

100
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,970
seven people as a technical expert and

101
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,650
scares everyone else not so much in

102
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,170
other countries it's sometimes

103
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,530
more extreme for example uk which isn't

104
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,810
part of the european union any more

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,080
but there we have twenty two technical

106
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,540
experts regarding two six hundred and fifty

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,800
eight non technical personnel so does his

108
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,230
bit more extreme does case soda or

109
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,600
public authorities are very depend

110
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,170
and on the populace too i will

111
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,610
talk to them regarding our data breaches

112
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,250
and to coming to rollins questioned and

113
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,200
yeah i have i have heard of

114
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,970
german citizens swing while nato websites themselves

115
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,760
in germany you can't sue of bad

116
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,420
upside because of data privacy breach you

117
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,400
have to make an immigrant to the

118
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,640
local authority in this case to do

119
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,380
well data protection authority in germany data

120
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,940
protection is a thing for the specific

121
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,920
german states for example in

122
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,570
my case i'm living in a state

123
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,670
of saxony on the halt in germany

124
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,460
and just recently am working as a

125
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,740
data protection officer as well and just

126
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,140
recently i've actually had a case where

127
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,960
an online shop was suit

128
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,500
and by a person who wasn't a

129
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,140
client from that shop because the shop

130
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,480
dwell did i

131
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,220
did had some settings that ran exactly

132
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,370
gdp are conform so

133
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,870
it had it happens but you can

134
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,240
sue at least germany's you can sue

135
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,780
a website directly but you can make

136
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,210
an inquiry at a jar with your

137
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,600
local data protection authority so this has

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,700
happened this happens sometimes a lot but

139
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,860
not so much in germany as it

140
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,470
is in some other countries for example

141
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,800
many complaints were made in italy and

142
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,750
spain if i recall correctly

143
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,200
surprisingly not so much in germany new

144
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,020
rare as are regarding stereotypes re drums

145
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,656
have a bit of an

146
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,770
every bit of the offices in germany

147
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,940
do not have a bit of an

148
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,700
image as other big complainers about in

149
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:24,690
other countries it was well far worse

150
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,430
to beat her to be put in

151
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,280
brackets in this case about to be

152
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,950
answering their trolley yes it happens yes

153
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,760
it happened

154
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,390
ah and this is not so much

155
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,980
to fault in this case of the

156
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,530
weapon that it takes solution itself but

157
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,460
of the company who uses this solution

158
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,730
for example when you normally use google

159
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,780
analytics and a generous setting when you're

160
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,350
just

161
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,550
implement google analytics but moto mo as

162
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,540
well with the well default settings they

163
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,990
aren't gdp are compliant you need to

164
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,480
put them in some kind of sandbox

165
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,530
the typical cookie banners this case and

166
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,460
do you have to ask your customers

167
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,410
or your users to rep said users

168
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,730
before you track anything from them you

169
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,920
have to ask them if they are

170
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,890
okay with that and you have to

171
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,950
have an explicit yes and no button

172
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,920
and on this cookie banner and when

173
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:33,480
you do that you're fine when you

174
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,150
do it not well up until this

175
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,179
year may be there wasn't a data

176
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,840
protection authority who well was complaining about

177
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,130
it but it happens rally that beginning

178
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,500
at least in germany beginning with next

179
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,059
year to public authorities declared

180
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,740
that they would

181
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,780
controlled these well for example websites or

182
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,750
businesses or companies or whatever but it

183
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,170
would control the world gdp are complied

184
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,330
see far more thoroughly so that some

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,250
some things at least will change in

186
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,240
twenty twenty two

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,710
and this case but moving on i

188
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,000
hope i answered your question

189
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,730
well for gathering these factories so not

190
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
much has changed in everyday lives of

191
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,250
the people may be that some people

192
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,460
are complaining about having to click on

193
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,150
so many cookie bearers on websites at

194
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,760
least debts are what what i get

195
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,360
in germany that

196
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,910
people are like to complain that with

197
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,700
the gdp are everything is far more

198
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,580
complicated and you well at least that's

199
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,070
what i'm saying they are complaining about

200
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,980
having to make a decision

201
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,510
i saw i guessed this will become

202
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,540
a far more used to in the

203
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,990
coming years but right now re putting

204
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,230
aside this nuisance in this case not

205
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,350
much has changed and at least the

206
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,540
public sees it that way as well

207
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,070
that of the at the

208
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,305
is it across countries don't have much

209
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:19,635
expertise in the topic so in essence

210
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:23,085
why should a populace care about using

211
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,855
data friendly solutions

212
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,465
right now it's a bit of a

213
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:31,155
nuisance in some countries data protection is

214
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:33,555
even seen as a while kind of

215
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,095
hindering stone for innovation or up

216
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:42,285
for other sing other things so why

217
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:43,545
should the populace care

218
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,435
this case

219
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:48,615
sorry for the german-speaking part in this

220
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,645
case but i will translate are well

221
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,895
one big part could be

222
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:58,815
corona corona pandemic and his case and

223
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,975
use of the german recall it home

224
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,105
office no offense to brits in this

225
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,745
case to the homeless to remote working

226
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:08,745
situations we have at least since march

227
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:09,735
twenty twenty

228
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:14,355
different in many countries but at least

229
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:17,115
in germany i doubt was

230
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:21,975
a survey made by the b v

231
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:25,875
d w decison the german and

232
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:32,505
ah that cant earnest german association of

233
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:36,165
form at the digital to digital business

234
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:39,045
economics so indebted day the survey any

235
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,485
read regarding

236
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,375
can you imagine working in home office

237
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:49,695
working remotely because of covert or after

238
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:53,025
that as well and this case around

239
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:56,025
through re quarters seventy five point four

240
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:59,355
percent said yeah i can imagine working

241
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:01,665
from now on remotely

242
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:04,665
keep a sixty six per cent or

243
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:10,275
even expect their employers to happen appropriate

244
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,665
technical as well other kind of solution

245
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:17,445
for work remotely and fifty eight percent

246
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,575
even set that i want to have

247
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,825
the explicit possibility

248
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,925
eighty of working remotely

249
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,215
in this case in germany we had

250
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:33,135
some and not laws but some guidances

251
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,365
that came to effect during the lockdown

252
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:40,275
phases of the pandemic but they row

253
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:43,365
while they were were running out during

254
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:45,945
the re of the summer so they

255
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,625
are no longer in effect in germany

256
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:51,405
however in neighbouring austria since april they

257
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,865
even have a home office loss so

258
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:54,465
diskettes were

259
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:57,465
the mold working loss so very different

260
00:12:57,465 --> 00:13:00,405
situation depending on the country but at

261
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,165
is the german populace wishes to half

262
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:06,675
warm of it's possibilities but they doubt

263
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:10,057
as with the public authorities they doubted

264
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,125
that their employers are ready for that

265
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,625
so and disaster

266
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:18,435
white is the right survey i was

267
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:23,325
asking questions is your employer well technically

268
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:26,055
ready so have dated do they have

269
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,965
the technical infrastructure too

270
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:33,318
enable you to work remotely and discuss

271
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:36,075
fifty four percent said yes but also

272
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:39,315
forty five per cent said no and

273
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,015
regarding the mistrust of an employer does

274
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,835
this even higher so this for once

275
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:49,515
also regarding blocked out phases maybe some

276
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:50,145
of you

277
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,515
you experienced this in your countries as

278
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:55,455
well when you had lockdowns up i've

279
00:13:55,485 --> 00:14:00,345
here had some newspaper clippings regarding the

280
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,045
consequences of lockdown for example

281
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:05,595
in cologne

282
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:11,145
there even was an app developed regarding

283
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:15,345
the well kuroda regulations chaos debt and

284
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:18,675
suit because every state made more or

285
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:20,775
less their own rules there was a

286
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:24,735
bit of chaos there also regarding the

287
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:26,715
so-called home schooling so

288
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:30,555
add to the lockdown and the locked

289
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:34,425
on a school school stuff sorry i

290
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:37,965
which was also a big mess at

291
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:40,755
least in germany so that the typical

292
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:43,155
a joke was going on yeah what

293
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:46,785
do we expect only teachers working

294
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,305
in schools they don't have a clue

295
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:52,755
about i t infrastructure so of course

296
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,975
for example when december and a heart

297
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:58,005
lockdown was set in germany and first

298
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,035
day of so called homeschooling i was

299
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,965
done of course every sarah was well

300
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:07,185
stressed to the seams

301
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,685
https and broke down

302
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,825
so in this case regarding corona and

303
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,465
doctor one situation people are

304
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:21,165
on one hand bit in mistrust regarding

305
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,265
data protection but on the other hand

306
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:27,645
see well digitalization as a necessity at

307
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:31,665
least and maybe in combination of the

308
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:36,705
two and the well populace will develop

309
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:41,025
up to a prospective that i'm working

310
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,185
more and more in the digital realm

311
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:48,855
but who controls my employer that he's

312
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:52,035
not sniffing after me that he's not

313
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,825
trying to survey me to spy on

314
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:55,095
me

315
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:58,905
and at least in germany i've got

316
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:00,495
he has some paper clippings as well

317
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:04,515
regarding the while general

318
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:08,895
while the general outlook for example especially

319
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,655
not for example especially with regards to

320
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,725
the gay from economy is so google

321
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:17,895
amazon facebook metre apple microsoft etc

322
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:20,145
they are what

323
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:25,035
general and mistrust i especially like that

324
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:27,765
one thing that sat at well regarding

325
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:31,185
google pay and co at they are

326
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:36,885
warning once again of them so even

327
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:39,795
the journalists are getting tired of while

328
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,505
reporting about day

329
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:44,595
data protection incidents with facebook with google

330
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:47,595
with everyone else so on one hand

331
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,955
people don't really like data protection because

332
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:53,625
well it's an it's an hindrance isn't

333
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:57,675
it's nuisance it's a well staff to

334
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:00,465
do that i don't want to do

335
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:01,665
about

336
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,525
on the other hand we are at

337
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,915
least when our regarding germany we are

338
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:11,474
a very mistrustful folk regarding big corporations

339
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:12,855
it has a lot to do with

340
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:16,694
our history regarding kings and koreans doing

341
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:20,444
as they please regarding the national socialist

342
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:21,825
regime in the nineteen thirties and

343
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:24,645
forties regarding the stasi in the german

344
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:27,885
democratic republic and add iron curtain stuff

345
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:29,865
that happens so

346
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,285
we value on one hand and at

347
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,555
least germany b we value our privacy

348
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:41,415
very high but data protection is for

349
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:43,575
many is seen as some kind of

350
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:47,235
a nuisance so this is bit schizophrenic

351
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:49,905
discourse but that's a situation at eastern

352
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:51,105
germany where we are

353
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:51,255
r

354
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:53,055
and

355
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:57,345
to summarize this one so remote work

356
00:17:57,345 --> 00:18:00,075
is more prevalent the dangerous for data

357
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:02,955
privacy are more apparent at one thing

358
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:05,565
that works in germany very very good

359
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,875
to stuffed think about the children for

360
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,635
example in school when you have to

361
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:14,055
work with for example zoo with microsoft

362
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:14,385
teams

363
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:17,745
with whatever often it's the case

364
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,285
that are teachers as well as parents

365
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:23,205
as well as the general populace they

366
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,545
say well if it works it works

367
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:29,325
and it's free so it's okay that's

368
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,675
the one hand but on the other

369
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:35,295
hand the well safety of children of

370
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:39,105
families as well as to genoa safety

371
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:43,575
as a stressed very highly so as

372
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,675
i said a bit of a schizophrenic

373
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:46,965
situation this case

374
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,295
but something at least the german speaking

375
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:56,805
countries have at least some kind of

376
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:58,995
well as sensibility in this case so

377
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,425
they say we while we have to

378
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:05,115
do something to keep us safe what

379
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:08,055
i dunno that's to general

380
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:12,405
thing does case but authorities are controlling

381
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:13,725
more often as i said in the

382
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,505
beginning twenty twenty two at the german

383
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:21,075
data protection authorities said that it wants

384
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,895
and will control more frequently

385
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:29,565
so what can we do regarding matomo

386
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,625
so what strategies could we apply for

387
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,405
once we meet to look more abroad

388
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,835
in this case we need to look

389
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:41,715
at other countries when we are living

390
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:45,105
in europe at the gdp arts

391
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:47,175
often seen as our some kind of

392
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:52,185
nuisance at least regarding international situations of

393
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,675
these countries that are on this map

394
00:19:54,825 --> 00:20:00,225
green day rare implementing laws in recent

395
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:02,775
years that had a g d p

396
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,085
r as a template as an explicit

397
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:09,585
template some countries are not doing so

398
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,885
rally regarding data protection for example brazil

399
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:16,035
at are also and australia this is

400
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,765
a well not that good of situation

401
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,975
about the distance because that other laws

402
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:24,225
are lacking the united states for example

403
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,365
the state of california

404
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,665
it's demanded a specific law that was

405
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,435
modeled after the gdp are

406
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:34,695
but unfortunately california as part of the

407
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:37,425
united states and this case and united

408
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:41,775
states have laws like the u s

409
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,475
freedom act do you as cloud act

410
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:50,085
and other laws that are above the

411
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,795
california law and

412
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:56,235
and enable public administration in this case

413
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:59,505
a specific offices like the national security

414
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:02,115
agency and as a and ah

415
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:05,235
other are well security organs of the

416
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:10,125
state to well spy out everything that

417
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,035
is saved on a server even if

418
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:14,925
it's in europe to use cloud act

419
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:16,905
which came to effect on twenty eighteen

420
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:21,375
explicitly states that in regards of homeland

421
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,515
security and stuff like that

422
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,725
i'd add that the public authorities are

423
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:31,665
enabled to control every white person corporation

424
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:32,773
etc

425
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:36,675
and the stuff that they are having

426
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:39,338
for example they can control everything at

427
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:42,705
that is saved on any microsoft service

428
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:45,795
because microsoft has its seat in the

429
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:48,435
united states even if the server isn't

430
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,655
germany the company is the united states

431
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,955
that's degenerate problem discussed so

432
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:56,925
on the one hand the dpr isn't

433
00:21:57,225 --> 00:22:00,735
as template as a model for well

434
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:03,795
similar laws and the world but on

435
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:06,435
the other hand we have i don't

436
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:08,055
want to call a loophole but we

437
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:09,645
have another situation

438
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:11,415
okay

439
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:16,035
where we have other countries that are

440
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:20,535
well gdp are compliant with out having

441
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:23,685
the gdp are as a law in

442
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:26,775
their country so on the one hand

443
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:29,445
we can look into countries that are

444
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:32,595
that are that are having laws specifically

445
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,478
i made after duty pr mp for

446
00:22:35,478 --> 00:22:37,275
pixar before marketing and stuff like that

447
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:40,425
so there we could market matomo as

448
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:42,585
a good alternative also

449
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,845
and these countries that are heal labels

450
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:51,105
are labour green we can also have

451
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,395
the gdp are

452
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:57,315
as a some kind of our quality

453
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:57,975
seal

454
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:02,025
because matomo is open source and everything

455
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:05,505
else it's a good starting point for

456
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:08,925
having a while gdp are compliant tool

457
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:14,025
and discount with europe or canada while

458
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,505
for commercial organizations at least so canada

459
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:19,335
is half and half in this case

460
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:22,965
i regarded safe paddock states or the

461
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:26,625
countries of switzerland of norway of iceland

462
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:29,505
of argentina uruguay

463
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:36,045
new zealand south korea japan israel and

464
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:39,735
well some other countries as well like

465
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:44,055
the channel isles soda of these were

466
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,505
specific constituency that are and are not

467
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,515
part of great britain as well as

468
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:50,355
some

469
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:50,475
hm

470
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:55,875
other parts of black the faroe islands

471
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:58,365
up in the northern seat and they

472
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,035
have a specific situation regarding their legal

473
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:02,985
status so they are part of it

474
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,625
as well and the fun stuff actually

475
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:10,155
is since brexit great britain officially became

476
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:11,685
at least for three years

477
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:13,755
gdp are compliant again

478
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:16,575
but i would call this more like

479
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:20,535
a political dealing than real well real

480
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,805
act the legislation escaped by the channel

481
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:27,615
islands disconnected island of guernsey or the

482
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,835
isle of man and there are more

483
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:32,745
gp are compliant than the whole of

484
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:34,155
the uk this case

485
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:38,025
because they have a so-called adequacy decision

486
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:41,145
from the european commission so does this

487
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:42,885
some kind of knob

488
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,395
while you you apply for that to

489
00:24:46,395 --> 00:24:49,095
some kind of application at this or

490
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:53,265
a multi step and a multi year

491
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:57,195
inspection of the loss and after practices

492
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:59,355
in the specific countries that are applying

493
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:02,745
for these adequacy decisions and for example

494
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:04,155
in june twenty two

495
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:07,875
the one south korea was admitted after

496
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:11,745
three years of being observed and while

497
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:15,315
applying for the status of an adequacy

498
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:18,075
decision dpr compliant whatever you want to

499
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:21,315
call it a country so these countries

500
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:24,975
a half loss and the effect that

501
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,195
are on the same level as the

502
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,075
gdp are in the european union so

503
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:34,065
in this case every company every citizen

504
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:38,265
every corporation every entity this country have

505
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:39,195
had has to have

506
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:44,775
well technical solutions tools software that is

507
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:49,094
in essence gdp are compliant so potomac

508
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:53,595
could look into these countries regarding getting

509
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,275
a foothold and

510
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:00,315
though in this case to differentiate it

511
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:03,165
more clearly from tools like google analytics

512
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:05,595
and stuff because you could at least

513
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,545
in this country still blue rods are

514
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:08,835
part of the european union the green

515
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:11,925
ones are safe in this case because

516
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:14,175
of this these countries you can argue

517
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:16,185
with legal consequences

518
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:18,525
when does use google analytics in these

519
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:21,045
countries and you don't do it right

520
00:26:21,675 --> 00:26:24,315
you can get well suit or have

521
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:27,075
to pay a fine or whatever and

522
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:30,015
regarding the gdp are at fine can

523
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:33,585
go up to twenty million euros per

524
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:36,645
case or risk his scenario

525
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:38,715
four percent of europe

526
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:43,755
of your global revenue locked up sorry

527
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,805
global income

528
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:49,275
sole to gross income to be exact

529
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:52,425
africa sample and twenty nineteen

530
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:56,085
google was sentenced in france to pay

531
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:59,475
a fine of fifty million euros and

532
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:03,795
just this year amazon was in awe

533
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:06,705
thing was sweden spent somewhere into your

534
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:07,815
opinion did i have to look it

535
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:10,575
up where exactly but amazon had to

536
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:13,155
pay a fine of four sam of

537
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:13,635
seven

538
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:19,455
one hundred million years because every one

539
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:24,375
of these companies they were well violating

540
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,215
data protection

541
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:29,985
so and risk case scenario google is

542
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,993
fined and you have to pay a

543
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:34,125
fine as well because you are using

544
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:38,205
google you are using an illegal software

545
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:40,875
and at least regarding to germany

546
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:43,905
we have the

547
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:47,415
ref the local authorities as a set

548
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:49,695
or the data protection in germany as

549
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:52,125
part of us as a as a

550
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,195
matter for the states so not the

551
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:57,405
federal government is doing the data protection

552
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:00,315
but every state has a specific office

553
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:05,085
and the state's officials are meeting at

554
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:05,235
le

555
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:07,365
just once a year for so called

556
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,495
federal data protection meetings and at least

557
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:16,005
in september twenty twenty at the

558
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:20,475
conference data protection conference germany add as

559
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:21,465
set that

560
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:23,925
an american

561
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:29,445
specifically you asked american companies are not

562
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,065
legal in germany

563
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:36,105
day as explicitly mentioned are marks of

564
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:39,933
three sixty five and just under february

565
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:43,035
of this year the data protection authority

566
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,885
in the state of berlin set the

567
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:48,735
dead for example cisco webex was illegal

568
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:51,645
to discuss cisco webex was mentioned specifically

569
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:52,245
but up

570
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:55,215
among others like zoom as well this

571
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:59,085
caster stead of batman burton back or

572
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:02,145
witches in the south rest one after

573
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:06,075
richard's richest states in germany a day

574
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:09,705
well more or less outlawed zoom in

575
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:12,045
twenty twenty and march twenty twenty then

576
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:12,435
zoo

577
00:29:12,435 --> 00:29:16,755
you did some paperwork and the outlawing

578
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:20,235
was a while was reversed and justice

579
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:24,285
while general warning label that every united

580
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:26,925
states company has in germany was applied

581
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,815
but in any case

582
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,265
the at is public authorities have a

583
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:33,135
very

584
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,455
very us put up are putting very

585
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:41,505
strict eye on every united states based

586
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:43,935
company on this case on every non

587
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:45,615
e u based company

588
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:52,305
kit so and regarding once again the

589
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:55,845
well disguised companies but also part they

590
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:57,375
are part of the general populace so

591
00:29:57,945 --> 00:29:59,355
that should count that were as well

592
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,915
discuss french companies or ask so what

593
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:06,855
are the implications of the gdp are

594
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:10,305
according to what french data driven and

595
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:13,005
non data driven companies so in essence

596
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:13,305
to

597
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,945
light blue once aura regarding data driven

598
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:20,955
companies to dark blue rods are done

599
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:24,105
data driven companies so in general

600
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,952
i t digital internet based companies on

601
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:31,455
one hand and more or less traditional

602
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,405
companies on the other hand

603
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,970
and it and genoa of the traditional

604
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,040
companies seated deeper are more as a

605
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,940
constraint

606
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,350
were asked to a data driven company

607
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,570
soda more or less i t based

608
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,840
companies seated gdp are at while disguised

609
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,630
as a guideline to improve marketing strategies

610
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,270
as well as an opportunity for customer

611
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,930
relationship

612
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,250
some also see it as a constraint

613
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,740
but in this case a more data

614
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,610
room companies see de paris a general

615
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,810
good thing for while developing their marketing

616
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,923
strategies as well as to customer relationships

617
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:18,200
so they see it as an opportunity

618
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,250
so discus to make the best out

619
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,860
of the law in the best case

620
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,500
scenario even to make it as a

621
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,060
part of and use p

622
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,510
and discussed a unique selling point could

623
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,050
be we our gdp are complied we

624
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,800
value your privacy something that matomo already

625
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,710
does so nothing new for you guys

626
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,100
at least

627
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,810
but

628
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,640
something that also many companies seem so

629
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,110
discuss the public opinion at least in

630
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,630
well i t centric industries is more

631
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:04,216
pro gd pr than contract dpr because

632
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,580
the

633
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,510
sorry because dub

634
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,080
companies are already working with data they

635
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,490
are fluent in this field etc so

636
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,290
a company could best case scenario could

637
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,450
use the gdp are in gdp are

638
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,270
complied tools in this case as an

639
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,470
advantage in contrast to their to their

640
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,480
opposition to their job

641
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,100
to to to other parts of france

642
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,900
thread on that the rudder is right

643
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,990
now and one company that does it

644
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,260
is actually my my own company but

645
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,870
i come to that admitted that data

646
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,090
driven companies are for example these wants

647
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,850
some of dams you have heard some

648
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,210
may be

649
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,490
not a trello maybe heard of them

650
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,440
they are part of at lesean now

651
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,920
so de australia based and others like

652
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,590
monday dot com black dropbox asana ever

653
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,649
know there are u s based at

654
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:07,730
the ones on the bottom mind meister

655
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,000
meister task a down austrian based company

656
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,080
so they are

657
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,250
on the standard settings gdp are friendly

658
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,950
because they they must be they have

659
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,390
to be it's law

660
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,400
so for example these are some but

661
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,830
when you look at other companies that

662
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,490
are mostly and well communications sector

663
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,422
some of them are very very good

664
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:38,330
to regarding gdp our compliance for example

665
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,460
when you look at messages like a

666
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,060
signal like three ma also open source

667
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,400
stuff like gizzi all right now we're

668
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:49,250
the big blue button these are okay

669
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,760
but some have a bit of a

670
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,150
dwell

671
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,290
mixed image this case when you look

672
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,690
at zoom they are bakery owner of

673
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,640
the pandemic you have to admit that

674
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,180
at least i and many many that

675
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,120
are using zoom they think well it's

676
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,120
such a great service it's relined it's

677
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,870
blah blah blah

678
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,710
where as zoom is actually a very

679
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,880
data hungry service also a very dirty

680
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,580
service as well and there's a website

681
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,580
called a website carbon dot com where

682
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,460
you can put in domains and they

683
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,210
will well recount how much c o

684
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,080
two how much

685
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,610
gram c o two

686
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,469
does it cost in wealth energy in

687
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,340
and energy production or when you want

688
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,800
to look up that site and for

689
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,719
example i once tested that one was

690
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,027
with my old site we came round

691
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,400
out zero point six nine gram per

692
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,420
website use rare zoom has around eight

693
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,650
or nine gram

694
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,420
so tenfold

695
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,770
and stuff so in this case reddit

696
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,080
used an external service disc has wins

697
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,540
u s based also and you have

698
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,490
to have to take into account the

699
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,120
environmental friendliness so how

700
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:21,530
don't have to read where no sorry

701
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,710
but while how good for the environment

702
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,710
how reliable how

703
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,690
three how sustainable as how sustainable is

704
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,270
the service as well this is one

705
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,090
thing that comes more into effect right

706
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,561
now for example when you look at

707
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:42,530
a fragile future and other movements

708
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,650
so in this case a potomac can

709
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,610
make points as well regarding where you

710
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,620
can install the trouble on your own

711
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,590
servers so you can decide how environmental

712
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,140
friendly it will become but also how

713
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,040
regional service will be you don't have

714
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,230
to communicate all the time with united

715
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,710
states

716
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,170
for other countries to add a service

717
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,110
art so you can decide this case

718
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,670
also another thing that deserves on the

719
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,610
right bottom that's cisco webex or the

720
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,760
old logo of cisco webex and for

721
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,350
example cisco has a seal mate

722
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,200
that at least was a one time

723
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,680
i didn't seminar for a federal agency

724
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,800
and are also warned about the tomoe

725
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,960
air guitar and what about cisco it's

726
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,090
tough cisco webex had stuff that were

727
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,120
tomita was all right and fine but

728
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,980
rabbits i want about them because while

729
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,270
they aren't us based

730
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,450
but then the federal agency told me

731
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,920
no no no but it's our ride

732
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,050
we haven't had this case we have

733
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,960
a weather seal made by the german

734
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,890
bullous emphysema jihad indeed matsuda technic orchards

735
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:02,720
editor a federal agency for safety endurable

736
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,860
digital infrastructure

737
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,880
baxter while the bad point is

738
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,020
that this seal i looked up at

739
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,550
they have this seal

740
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,300
but while it's not something that the

741
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,630
federal agency itself makes but you more

742
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,760
or less can ask your tax advisor

743
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,150
to

744
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,630
give it to you because there are

745
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,900
well they are the make and all

746
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,600
that at at your company and they

747
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,300
say wrong everything seems fine and i

748
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,240
will get my payment so many many

749
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,140
marketing jargon going on here but that

750
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,910
could be something as well all this

751
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,360
company has

752
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,940
have a sometimes very flimsy

753
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,120
excuses were the tape but we our

754
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,310
gdp are complied we are safe re

755
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:55,010
looking out after human riots and stuff

756
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,500
like that and here's our seal of

757
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,720
approval for from the federal government and

758
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,910
stuff like that so something that you

759
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,060
could acquire very easily with matomo as

760
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,970
well so to put yourself on

761
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,550
at least the same level of trust

762
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,330
that these companies said that day half

763
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,160
off say that there are

764
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,450
okay and other companies as well regarding

765
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,910
data driven us up and look at

766
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,220
marks of three fixed or three sixty

767
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,100
five or google workspace they are in

768
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,500
general lot gdp are complied but we'll

769
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,204
look at other companies like nextcloud data

770
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:35,390
as a german best company and will

771
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,140
cloud service

772
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,390
i guess some of you may have

773
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,430
heard of it or an old cloud

774
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,680
that was not as why was a

775
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,050
part of flex cloudless as a with

776
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,090
all sorts of was the scotus essentially

777
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,790
fork of owncloud lag with open office

778
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,920
and a libra library office

779
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,580
i'll offer another company the r seminar

780
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,650
that is my own fulfilling glory

781
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,939
we are working with them apia at

782
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,370
with some apia from nextcloud we are

783
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,680
also working with a big blue button

784
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,780
for our video-conferencing and at least we

785
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,510
ourselves are marketing

786
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,350
the use of open source products we

787
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,440
also use metabo forest statistics and we

788
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,350
market that as well we are using

789
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,440
for example an app called tomorrow that

790
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,740
is essentially green and a sustainable banking

791
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,220
this case and we position ourselves with

792
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,643
debt so when we

793
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,120
for example are looking at our campus

794
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,410
or campus

795
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,870
a disaster or some kind of an

796
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,960
office cloud-like with microsoft through sixty five

797
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,930
a recent german that you can rock

798
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,620
their collaboratively and also secure in the

799
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,890
cloud because we're using the open source

800
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,090
solution we're in we're based in germany

801
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,671
and stuff like that

802
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,660
also with a talk blast that was

803
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,720
actually his big blue button but while

804
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,580
remarketed in another rape

805
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,640
also are with other products we often

806
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,630
discuss our media library and everything disc

807
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,910
as we are say it's well regional

808
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,450
based so the service on germany company

809
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,380
is germany we are sustainable because we

810
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,670
look that we only have to

811
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:33,020
energy sources route one case original but

812
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,080
also er we only use well equal

813
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:40,280
energy for this is one big big

814
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,450
pink stone and that our partners our

815
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,970
tea parties or infrastructure partners have to

816
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,600
make that they can guarantee and also

817
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,780
then that they can proof that they

818
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,440
use the data centers at that their

819
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:02,010
power the data centers only with sustainable

820
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,060
energy also regarding security because we are

821
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,390
based in gdp our country auto with

822
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,730
the data protection as well as d'etre

823
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,570
half while the regarded as that we

824
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,090
have some dean or e s o

825
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,820
lord stir i s o twenty seven

826
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,110
thousand and one

827
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,110
as for example one regarding data security

828
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,420
data privacy in this case stuff like

829
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,990
that for a while discuss one specific

830
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,850
company with the our seminar we even

831
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,730
market more or less we market the

832
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,520
gdp are as a unique selling point

833
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,420
of our company

834
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,710
and we specifically target this case of

835
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:51,330
example lawyers or doctors or other germany

836
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,160
would urge would call it a boof

837
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,470
skybus tag or so

838
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,670
did most nearest translation would be as

839
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,850
you are secret keepers are based on

840
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,360
your job

841
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,500
when you're a lawyer you are forbidden

842
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,220
germany you are forbidden to use messengers

843
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,100
like or whatsapp or skype etc you

844
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,900
have to use secure messenger sp discourse

845
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,090
like a three ma all like signal

846
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:24,360
order messages like oh with elements which

847
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,720
are you

848
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,060
which i was using the utter metrics

849
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,540
standard stuff like that lars jeremy half

850
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,120
loudly at least legally i have to

851
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,930
use it as well

852
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:38,310
so

853
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,730
this could be a good entry point

854
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:44,100
point for potomac as well that you

855
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,700
can contact all that you can market

856
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,030
yourself for fucks up for companies offer

857
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,440
public authorities public authorities have to have

858
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,760
even more

859
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:01,140
the rules to follow regarding data protection

860
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,937
okay but what we take from here

861
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:06,690
is well remote work is more prevalent

862
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:10,260
the data for do a data privacy

863
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,300
are more apparent and wealth in fact

864
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,120
how do we approach the matter so

865
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,830
in this case we can do it

866
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,250
re guarding the gdp gbr compliance that

867
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,820
we put the gdp r s while

868
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,180
to

869
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,220
the biggest selling point for matomo also

870
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,270
that companies can check for themselves what

871
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,790
moto mo collects from data and also

872
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:39,270
that they render usta not on-premise but

873
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,070
do not variant of the talbot that

874
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,550
they have total control over their data

875
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,770
okay and with more or less a

876
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,630
good landing discuss sorry

877
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,470

878
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,800
