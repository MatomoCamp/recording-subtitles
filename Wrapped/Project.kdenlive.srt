1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,300
hello everyone

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,330
nice to meet you all again it's

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,210
currently a three or tooth and we

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,270
will have conducted a conference today so

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,000
i continue by with here weaver with

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,430
me and may sulfur one i shall

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,890
dunno and so the idea of this

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,590
conference is to do some sandwiches are

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,876
kind of unusual

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,929
so tommy's oh so we're gonna do

11
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,360
a use case and most of the

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,947
time when a use cases presented by

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,890
an analyst it's most of the time

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,390
like three quarters of the time the

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,919
analyst was picking and then a quarter

16
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,180
the timing is the the client here

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,740
is going to be the reverse a

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,870
mod so i will leave the floating

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,220
up in a couple of minutes

20
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,280
tour two kaddish who is a client

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,650
of mine and the idea that kathy

22
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,250
can i introduce you to projects that

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,980
she is walking on and i will

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,709
explain how i decided to deal with

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,440
the project management of including matter

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,490
all women deserve this given project and

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,740
so i leave now the floor to

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,450
to get here and i will interact

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,310
on leash or dealing with my part

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,910
of the site

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,960
okay thanks training artist stem

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,450
charmless lights

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,320
can i just chat you can see

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,890
that ronan

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,880
yes it looks great

36
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,740
lovely thank you and write so myself

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,900
and raining again to attitude share the

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,350
presentation today and the presentation is on

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,950
using matter mighty collect data on intervention

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,170
engagement within a research trial and the

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,750
case study isn't a project called wrapped

42
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,040
so the overview of the presentation is

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,890
the i'll firstly talk about why i

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,070
think it's important to measure intervention engagement

45
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,800
within a research trial i will tell

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,510
you a bit about the wrapped research

47
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,030
project to swell and then ronan's going

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,890
to talk about how we use matinee

49
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,960
within the project to collect endeavor

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,870
at your level data on engagement than

51
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,360
our present somalia insights from our analytics

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,770
data and and not be a chance

53
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,330
for some questions at the end

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,330
so festival why it's important to measure

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,670
intervention engagement with a new research trial

56
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,220
with arab are two reasons one is

57
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,400
to minimize something called non usage attrition

58
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,620
and are going to explain about our

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,020
protests and then also to examine and

60
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,150
control for intervention tos

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,170
so firstly onto minimizing non-eu such attrition

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,950
so when we are testing whether a

63
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,800
new intervention works then we typically decent

64
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,140
could a randomized control trial and many

65
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,300
of you will be aware of what

66
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,360
randomized controlled trials are already maybe but

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,280
they are am i to share my

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,880
next slide

69
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,620
so they are used all the time

70
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,840
in a clinical context to test the

71
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,510
effectiveness of something so that something could

72
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,330
be a new drug or a vaccine

73
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,500
as is the case with the kv

74
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,140
vaccine or in my case am an

75
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,070
imam house psychologists i develop interventions that

76
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,140
try to encourage people to change their

77
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,950
health behavior

78
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,540
that could be for example to to

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,673
persuade people to use the kite that

80
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,920
vaccine so the intervention itself and is

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
not a drug or a vaccine or

82
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,890
something like that it tends to be

83
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,010
an a behavior change intervention but the

84
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,870
principle of attesting it is exactly the

85
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,190
same so we would also run a

86
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,630
randomized controlled trial

87
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,652
and in randomized controlled trials we take

88
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:51,660
hair sample population so this is a

89
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,120
smaller group of the the white population

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,030
were interested in testing the intervention on

91
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,430
and will randomly assign them to two

92
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,800
groups so am i the flip of

93
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,660
a coin old bolla di saw more

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,450
commonly using sort of an internet based

95
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:06,960
randomizer

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,400
ocean tools but the idea is the

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,020
same it's just randomly assigning to one

98
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,870
group or the other on n and

99
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,580
the one groups with which have habits

100
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,800
great one at the old people are

101
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,510
not great that reminded me assigned to

102
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,550
it will get thief then the new

103
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,950
drug code or treatments and then we'll

104
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,920
measure afterwards and how they fare to

105
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,120
what the outcomes were for them

106
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,860
and then the other great thou get

107
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,300
to control so if it is a

108
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,320
drag it might be something like a

109
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,020
sugar pill that has no active ingredients

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,610
and game will mash at the outcome

111
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,490
for them an important point with randomisation

112
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,080
is that by the end we should

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,820
have balanced the groups or just by

114
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,520
chance we should have approximately even numbers

115
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,130
of people of different genders and ethnicities

116
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,280
or

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,670
all with similar levels of of healthy

118
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,370
your health condition and that's important to

119
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,070
make sure that we control finest of

120
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,320
confounding factors that made my also have

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,610
an effect on the outcome they should

122
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,320
then be evenly spread between the two

123
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,950
groups

124
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,360
so in a clinical context when a

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,700
new drug is being tested adherence to

126
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,170
the drug is not usually a big

127
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,630
problem although something do to me to

128
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,150
be mindful of 'em and this spirit

129
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,820
the turkey is prescribed by a clinician

130
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,270
and participants saw usually very closely supervised

131
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,280
so you'd be asked to go

132
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,556
go into a clinical context for example

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
a newbie pass that the pale on

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,220
a tray with a cup of water

135
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,200
i am watched by a research nurse

136
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,490
taking it who then recalled that you

137
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,230
taken it and that would likely be

138
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,990
for every dose and also as a

139
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,570
research participant he may well especially if

140
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,700
you are in the intervention condition experience

141
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,440
observable and immediate health

142
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,419
benefits of taking that drug ashamed that

143
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,700
it's effective and also potentially in the

144
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,010
control condition due to placebo effect so

145
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,690
there's lots of things that could be

146
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,470
and meaning that haven't that that drug

147
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,170
with an intervention and and trial context

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,390
am is not too much your problem

149
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,940
it's usually irritates usually reasonably high

150
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,370
however in contrast adherents is a major

151
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,460
problem why may testing ie health interventions

152
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,200
as i mentioned briefly about the kind

153
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,240
of what the itu sought to test

154
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,930
health behavior change interventions and also almost

155
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,430
all of the interventions that i developed

156
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,680
contest of the health type said their

157
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,760
intervention delivered by

158
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,280
via the internet so here the intervention

159
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,250
is neither prescribed nor critical to wellbeing

160
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,590
and this graph i think demonstrates quite

161
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,820
nicely and typical attrition from a health

162
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,110
interventions so on the y axis going

163
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,730
up the left you can see the

164
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,320
very top that a one and that

165
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,300
reflects one hundred per cent of users

166
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,640
of the intervention going down to nine

167
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,400
eighty eighty seventy etc or right down

168
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,020
to the air at the bottom and

169
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,880
then across the bottom on the x

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,910
axes we've got time and modules so

171
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,108
if we take the blue line is

172
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,700
at to start with the city by

173
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,329
favell done and this was a i

174
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,720
am a twelve week program of an

175
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,530
internet

176
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,410
and delivery of an intervention so exposed

177
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,450
to engage for twelve weeks in total

178
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:16,620
to have had the full dose of

179
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,720
the intervention but you can see after

180
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,130
a couple of weeks before he got

181
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,500
less than fifty percents of people i'm

182
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:25,650
still using that that am website going

183
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,500
down and to less than twenty percents

184
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,700
at week three and you can see

185
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,960
by the end by the law

186
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,970
less than one percent people still using

187
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,760
or still completing the intervention and right

188
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,430
at the very end and then four

189
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:40,920
and the dashed black line this was

190
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,270
an arm and a bench good mood

191
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,460
gym and it's in a trial context

192
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,220
again and there were five modules half

193
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,920
this intervention you can see that and

194
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,120
lessons have to present day

195
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,580
module two and module three less than

196
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,200
sixty percent and so on down to

197
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,180
just over twenty percent doing all five

198
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,000
modules and then the solid black line

199
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,640
is also moot gym but in this

200
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,800
context it wasn't in a trial and

201
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,060
it was just people allow to have

202
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,950
access to it then see who in

203
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,810
engage with that and carried on engaging

204
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,320
with it

205
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,810
and so outside the context of a

206
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,640
trial in which people might be incentivized

207
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,400
to to use the intervention and also

208
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,730
encouraged and reminded by researchers to do

209
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,500
so you can see the engagement is

210
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,280
even less

211
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,130
so non-use patricians a participant ceasing to

212
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,380
use the intervention in a trial context

213
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,980
and

214
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,740
it's obviously a big is a big

215
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,799
problem from a for us and m

216
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,840
if pockets are not using intervention in

217
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,970
trial contacts it makes it really difficult

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,250
task where the intervention actually works or

219
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:44,670
not

220
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,550
so in in trials and regardless of

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,100
i'm sorry to interest outcome data for

222
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,490
every participant is randomized included in the

223
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,130
analysis so if we have people in

224
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,720
not to be remembered at first

225
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,200
siakam i showed you have a randomized

226
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,850
controlled trials we've got people are under

227
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,560
my two creeps in and not top

228
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,990
arm we've got people who received the

229
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,360
intervention itself if i only got a

230
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,830
small portion of those who are actually

231
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,390
using intervention of fall you might be

232
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,200
thinking to yourself well just analyze data

233
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,340
from those people who use the intervention

234
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,440
itself and ignore it when asked who

235
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,560
do

236
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,870
patent but that in threatens the whole

237
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,940
integrity of the trial design which is

238
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,860
the randomisation of people to one group

239
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,170
or the other i explained earlier about

240
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,330
how we randomize so we have pilots

241
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,830
between the two arms but if you're

242
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,230
only including a a a sub group

243
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,057
of those people who have used the

244
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:42,090
intervention to a minimum extent and ignoring

245
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,720
everybody gauss

246
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,670
then you remove that balance which is

247
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,000
so important to that trial validity

248
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,810
so get the point of and of

249
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,720
ensuring that everybody regardless is what they

250
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,030
use the intervention or not in a

251
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,340
trial it's called intention to treat analysis

252
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,380
so if you randomize someone you will

253
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:07,620
always analyze that data regardless to ensure

254
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,360
we have got this balance in design

255
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:11,105
the problem of course is if you've

256
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,755
got a group of people in your

257
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,915
intervention condition that haven't used the intervention

258
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,865
at all or not very much then

259
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,025
if your intervention is indeed effective then

260
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:21,005
when you do the analysis a hussy

261
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,735
fact underestimated the effect the intervention cajoled

262
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:26,015
including in the analysis in the intervention

263
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,535
condition people who didn't even use it

264
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:29,885
at all or didn't use it very

265
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:30,035
much

266
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:32,405
such tool and remember that that diagram

267
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:34,025
of the dropping off steeply that is

268
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,875
often the case for us so it's

269
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,915
really really important the in in a

270
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,045
trial context that we do absolutely everything

271
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,985
that we can to minimize people not

272
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,145
using the intervention or dropping off

273
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,525
now ahead of doing a main trial

274
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,835
in which we test the effectiveness of

275
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,205
the kind of intervention that i've been

276
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,675
talking about we tend to do something

277
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:59,825
called earth a feasibility randomised controlled trial

278
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,564
which is exactly the same as a

279
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,935
randomized controlled trial with this randomisation to

280
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:05,705
the two groups the only thing that's

281
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,475
different is it's with much fewer parties

282
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,605
pence and the purpose of that kind

283
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:10,775
of study is to help us to

284
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:13,325
prepare for a full randomized controlled trial

285
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:15,965
and what we trying to do is

286
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,545
our resolve will remove all the unknowns

287
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,855
so for example helps to learn what

288
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:23,285
the best method for recruiting participants is

289
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,655
and what level of incentive we need

290
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:27,365
to recruit people in the first place

291
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:28,385
but water to keep them in the

292
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:29,795
trial until the end so those kind

293
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,385
of things are important for us to

294
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:33,605
establish this early phase before we do

295
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:34,385
the main thing

296
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,745
but what we could also use the

297
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:41,105
sp feasibility randomised controlled trials these preparation

298
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:45,845
preparation type trials is to examine non

299
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,285
use at attrition which we been talking

300
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,195
about so if we look at tricia

301
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,145
and in this early stage trial it

302
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,005
can tell us some important things such

303
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:54,755
as whether atr

304
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,325
ration is associated with particular demographic factors

305
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,885
and of course when we measuring those

306
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,965
in the surveys that we give to

307
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:02,705
people before they have the intervention and

308
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,385
then also afterwards and so if we

309
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,395
can link that demographic data right with

310
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:09,275
the day trip out attrition we can

311
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,225
learn some important things so if we

312
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:13,145
found out that for example females in

313
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:14,885
particular were using our intervention or

314
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,405
dropping off then it be important too

315
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:18,875
and maybe interview them as pot some

316
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,305
later studies and to find out why

317
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,498
that may might be the case and

318
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,025
try and rectify that and when we

319
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,375
look at the shape of the attrition

320
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,665
curve which we were we were just

321
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,105
looking at before that can tell us

322
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:31,085
something also important

323
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,225
so if we hearts i should have

324
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:35,705
kept my

325
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,035
mouse to do that yeah so if

326
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:41,495
we had a shape a bit set

327
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,925
alight rarely steep down like that that

328
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,245
would be a really bad sign for

329
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,825
our intervention tell us that people were

330
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,315
disengaging very quickly because i just didn't

331
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:52,925
like it and then this more can

332
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,835
have sigmoid style curve would tell us

333
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:56,915
that we have

334
00:12:56,915 --> 00:13:00,185
add some sort of initial interest in

335
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,625
it which then dropped off as you

336
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,945
might imagine then a bit of a

337
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,345
steep drop up in the metal parts

338
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:07,325
when there's less motivated people were leaving

339
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:10,385
or possibly representing some of usability style

340
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:12,605
problems and then we've got hard core

341
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,585
subset of users at the bottom so

342
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,834
that the style of and and shape

343
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:17,075
space

344
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,365
bows of this curve can tell us

345
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,865
some important things as well if we're

346
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:22,925
measuring attrition from our intervention jury not

347
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,565
a feasibility randomised controlled trial

348
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:31,325
so it is not uncommon for a

349
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,625
feasibility randomised controlled trials of a health

350
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,775
interventions to measure non use of nutrition

351
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:41,315
but measures of engagement are usually quite

352
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:44,075
limited and not so fine grained so

353
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:45,695
often it it's abouts

354
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:50,345
when people registering within the website itself

355
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:52,235
so we know who's visiting and we

356
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:54,095
know when they stopped visiting we might

357
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,625
talk about collect data on whether they've

358
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,235
completed modules within that website itself without

359
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:00,455
tends to be the limitation or the

360
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:03,605
limits of it and on the use

361
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:05,735
of analytics data rarely happens at all

362
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:06,995
but i've

363
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:09,095
she had become increasingly aware recently the

364
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:11,945
analytics data can offer much greater insight

365
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:14,585
into usability issues for example are the

366
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:18,845
particular point steering the and the different

367
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:20,225
stages in which people are going through

368
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,685
the intervention why they're experiencing some technical

369
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:25,355
issues that just is not very nice

370
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,585
the look and feel over time people

371
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:27,125
are dropping off

372
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:28,985
having problems with it and these are

373
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:29,765
the kind of things that can be

374
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:31,505
rectified which we don't cut this kind

375
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,155
of data we won't know nothing about

376
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:37,115
and and typically within feet split them

377
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,825
into mice control trials we tend to

378
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:40,835
have a stage of qualitative research we

379
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,725
do interviews with our participants to find

380
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:44,645
out more about their experience begin to

381
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,025
be such participants and what we can

382
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,315
learn to improve the trial

383
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:48,905
and this would be a great stage

384
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:51,455
at which to ask people to which

385
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,375
we can draw hypotheses from these usability

386
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,625
issues and then envelop the further through

387
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,185
those interviews to find out more about

388
00:14:57,185 --> 00:14:59,915
people's experiences those two things with dr

389
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,055
really nicely together

390
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:06,575
and so yeah we we can do

391
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:09,425
these feasibility randomized controlled trials and examine

392
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,825
usability issues with a with a view

393
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:15,035
to properly preparing a much better armor

394
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,475
and resolving any of these issues in

395
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:19,445
preparation for the main trial and i

396
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:20,915
just want to make the point that

397
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,355
i'm very aware that within

398
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:25,205
that and the tax at web industry

399
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:30,155
sector that usability and examining the acts

400
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:32,195
of client or customer's use of of

401
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:33,725
website and all these friction points and

402
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,165
things are going wrong in order to

403
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:38,015
maximize engagement and getting people through to

404
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:39,875
the end point where that might be

405
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,305
like purchasing something is done really

406
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:45,785
commonly and very well but really in

407
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,615
my field it's not it's rarely done

408
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,235
at all not by much toll and

409
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:50,735
i just know this a huge amount

410
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,475
to be learned and gained from i'm

411
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:54,845
collaborating with people who know much about

412
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,375
this not be really interested in hearing

413
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,505
from somebody who would be interested in

414
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,885
working with me and that kind of

415
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:00,215
way

416
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:06,425
and so yeah i've hopefully sort of

417
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,045
up it made the case for why

418
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:10,745
it's important to look at and non

419
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:12,815
use at attrition and for minimizing not

420
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,765
in a trial we know it's important

421
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,955
to do that and running these types

422
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,054
of feasibility randomised controlled trials which are

423
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:21,095
really common as a great opportunity to

424
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:21,395
look

425
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:23,465
attrition and try and remedy at inducing

426
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:26,435
about it and i'm rarely and if

427
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:27,515
one else in my field just at

428
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:29,225
the beginning of trying to understand how

429
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,265
best to measure this type of nutrition

430
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:34,115
twins damn what's all the mashers and

431
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:35,975
things that we can collect telling us

432
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,895
and also to make the right sort

433
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,305
of changes so that in the main

434
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:40,985
trial we can actually have as high

435
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:41,555
of attrition

436
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,685
the attrition as possible when people don't

437
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:45,365
like the intervention that's another thing we

438
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:47,105
can't that's a different question to be

439
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,365
answered by bit to do with how

440
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:50,465
the website itself is operating i think

441
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:51,935
there's lots we can do about that

442
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:55,187
and on the the other issue an

443
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,315
and you've got to slice on this

444
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,575
one this much so small a point

445
00:16:57,575 --> 00:17:00,485
rarely but equally important is around examining

446
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:03,125
and controlling for dos and

447
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,625
so the amount or dose of an

448
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,875
intervention that a participant receives in a

449
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,944
trial can affect the strength that the

450
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:14,855
outcome so again back to that randomisation

451
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,535
that we talked about those in the

452
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:19,625
the top arm he received an intervention

453
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:20,885
so we look to see what the

454
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:23,105
outcomes are so if it's an stop

455
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,515
smoking intervention for example

456
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:27,095
will will measure number of cigarettes per

457
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,615
day the heart before the intervention then

458
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,685
afterwards nam will compare the two arms

459
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:32,735
to look to look at the number

460
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:36,575
of cigarettes smoked so we we need

461
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,822
to know the the dose of that

462
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,612
intervention soap it's a web invent should

463
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:41,765
be stop smoking we need to know

464
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:44,195
the amount of consumption of that website

465
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:44,675
have they gone

466
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,685
backlot every day if they reviewed after

467
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:48,485
then ordered everything i can that sort

468
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,585
of thing to know the dos and

469
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:51,875
that way we can control for the

470
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,495
in the analyses so we can have

471
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,009
and can just isolate the effect of

472
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,425
the intervention and not the amount that

473
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:59,285
happening but then also we can measure

474
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:00,995
the correlation of the strength of the

475
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,065
relationship between dose and outcome as well

476
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,475
knows kind of things are really important

477
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:04,835
for us to

478
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:08,195
understand but you can examine what you

479
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,665
don't measure so we really need to

480
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:11,555
understand what is the dose the amount

481
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:13,115
that people are having of our hr

482
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:14,705
interventions and and this has to do

483
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,115
with the main trial itself

484
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:21,695
so if we can measure dose and

485
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,575
and for this it's really important that

486
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,635
the outcomes are linked to each individual

487
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:30,695
participants in the study so if we

488
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,375
can measure dose then we can understand

489
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,875
things such as is there a linear

490
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,605
relationship between dose and outcome so in

491
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:37,475
other words the moth

492
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:39,545
the intervention the somebody has the greater

493
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:41,559
the benefit or is it there are

494
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,535
anonymous linear relationships at the point of

495
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,365
saturation at which that really make the

496
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:46,505
difference whether you have any more or

497
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,815
not or is the minimum dose everyone

498
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:49,955
needs to have in order for an

499
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:53,765
effect to be achieved and an analytics

500
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,795
data can also be used for this

501
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,635
and epiphytes with

502
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,735
the precise and detailed mashes of the

503
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:02,645
dose rates individual such as which pages

504
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:04,895
are accessed how long people spend on

505
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,445
each page which videos have been watched

506
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,005
and for how long

507
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:14,045
so am i now like to go

508
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,655
on selling a little bit about a

509
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:19,745
intervention the i developed called wrapped when

510
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,635
i say i not may alone me

511
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:23,885
with a fantastic team of other researchers

512
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,355
so am face a little bit about

513
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:30,335
the study we're doing so we're at

514
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,015
the stage of doing the feasibility randomized

515
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:34,535
controlled trials of the preparatory study before

516
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:37,055
the main trial on this aims to

517
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:39,365
establish if the main randomized controlled trial

518
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:42,995
is feasible and to inform our preparations

519
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:45,155
and we are using analytics data

520
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,845
her to better understand any possible usability

521
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,462
issues so that they can be addressed

522
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,085
ahead of the trial so to minimize

523
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:54,245
the non usage attrition that i talked

524
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:56,405
about also to learn how best to

525
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,565
measure dose in preparation for our main

526
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,945
randomized controlled trial

527
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:05,345
and so the rapt intervention itself i'm

528
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,355
going to show you in a minute

529
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:09,275
what the website looks like but just

530
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:10,955
a little bit of information about it

531
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,055
so it aims to increase condom use

532
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:16,565
by addressing factors such as people's attitudes

533
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:18,725
towards condoms what they feel positively or

534
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:20,610
negatively about them and the beliefs that

535
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,155
underlie the

536
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:25,765
peoples south africa seafo communicating about condoms

537
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:28,225
and niue so this is about and

538
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:30,295
body speaking how confident you feel to

539
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,765
raise condom use with a partner for

540
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,675
the first time and also how confident

541
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,565
you feel in and using them correctly

542
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,595
and it's also about increasing access to

543
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,725
condoms so about

544
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:44,125
making them more available to people through

545
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:48,085
and a condom distribution scheme and there

546
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:50,335
are six components in total which are

547
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:53,755
tailored to individual need so at the

548
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,615
very start of access the website we

549
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:58,585
ask our users to answer very quick

550
00:20:58,585 --> 00:21:00,865
yesterday questions about their main barriers to

551
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:01,945
condom use and then

552
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:03,685
get allocated between one and six of

553
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:07,375
the components so the infection itself hopefully

554
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,175
is quite closely aligned to that their

555
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,345
needs and interests

556
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:13,375
and there are three products which can

557
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,075
be ordered a trial pack of condoms

558
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:19,315
a condom carrier and access to a

559
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:21,085
service which supplies condoms on a monthly

560
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:23,605
basis and there are also three lots

561
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:27,565
of videos so i'm just going to

562
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:29,425
change my screen

563
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:32,125
to show you the

564
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:37,225
the website itself

565
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:41,365
and ceremony to shower if you can't

566
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:42,385
see this otherwise i'll let you to

567
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,545
she and everybody can so this is

568
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:48,265
the route websites and after vance those

569
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:50,005
few quick questions to start this is

570
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,705
what you will see and this person

571
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:55,135
here has been assigned all six intervention

572
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:57,685
components and these represented by these blocks

573
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:58,585
on the screen here

574
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:02,275
so am i wait and show you

575
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:03,205
all a bit but i should give

576
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:04,945
you a better flavor for it so

577
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:06,925
with the sample pack here we can

578
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:07,795
combat

579
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:10,975
so here people got the chance to

580
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,645
customize the pack it's m a box

581
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:15,175
with a tray and then they can

582
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,005
choose the color on an insult that

583
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:19,855
goes inside it and then they get

584
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:23,125
to buy just yet she thought

585
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:28,525
and then they get to order it

586
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,165
and it has am twelve different types

587
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:33,145
of condoms and three sachets of lube

588
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:33,955
inside though

589
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:39,115
and then we've got videos as well

590
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:41,575
so this one is about video video

591
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:45,415
analysis and of young people demoing how

592
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:48,685
to put on a condom correctly without

593
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:51,655
any errors and that there is both

594
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:52,705
of the videos is one of the

595
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,325
things to order but that just gives

596
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:55,225
you a bit of a flavor

597
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:56,905
oh from the website and what what

598
00:22:56,905 --> 00:22:57,625
it looks like

599
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,675
so just go back to the presentation

600
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:02,065
again

601
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:11,005
and sometimes data collection the study requires

602
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:14,275
participants in of a feasibility randomized controlled

603
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:16,675
trial to complete activities over a twelve

604
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:19,465
month period so they consent to study

605
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,955
and compete a survey and then they

606
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:25,135
get directed to either with a randomized

607
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:27,029
that go into and one on which

608
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:28,345
is to receive the wrapped intent

609
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:30,295
action website i've just shown you where

610
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:32,005
they get randomized to a control website

611
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:33,685
which has the same branding as of

612
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:36,085
color and logos but has very basic

613
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,425
static information on condom use and as

614
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:42,175
and sexual transmitted infections and then they

615
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:44,695
get sent another survey three three months

616
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:48,505
later and also a test for and

617
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:51,295
st eichel chlamydia which get sent my

618
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,795
contest gets get sent in the post

619
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,795
to them to complete and then at

620
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:57,625
six months another survey and then at

621
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,605
twelve months another survey and also the

622
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:03,715
same test for an std i said

623
00:24:03,715 --> 00:24:04,855
that they've been asked quite to do

624
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:06,625
quite a lot from us and they're

625
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,665
incentivized to complete those different activists

626
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:11,155
it is and we using some database

627
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:13,645
management software called rep right cap to

628
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,985
consent participants and to prompt them to

629
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:18,055
complete all those different activities i've just

630
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:20,866
told you bout and record their data

631
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,435
so it sends out the surveys to

632
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:24,565
them and we record their test results

633
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:25,945
for the st eyes in there as

634
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:26,245
well

635
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:29,395
now but copies used to direct participants

636
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,795
to the two different websites so its

637
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:34,525
its and that an automated email that

638
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:36,895
goes out to people after been randomized

639
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,515
which has a link into one of

640
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:40,195
the two different websites and they have

641
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,215
to click on that and then they'll

642
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:43,285
go to each the two different websites

643
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:47,545
and and every activity the any part

644
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:49,225
has been in that he does is

645
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,495
linked to a unique id ams evident

646
00:24:52,498 --> 00:24:53,935
they do is is locked against that

647
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:54,835
unique id

648
00:24:57,535 --> 00:25:00,055
so we knew we were going to

649
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:02,303
be running this feasibility randomized controlled trial

650
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:03,625
and we knew that we wanted to

651
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,775
be able to measure attrition and both

652
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,875
so broadly on an aggregate level so

653
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,095
individually typical look at things like demographic

654
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,255
data and how the links to attrition

655
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:15,085
then also to work out how best

656
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:16,105
to measure dose for

657
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:17,485
the main trial so that we can

658
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:20,245
understand that important things about how dose

659
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:22,585
relates to outcomes but we really didn't

660
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:24,115
know how to go about doing this

661
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,555
we wanted to make more fine grained

662
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:27,955
than just and the website itself could

663
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,805
tell us and i was already beginning

664
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:34,195
to become interested in analytics data and

665
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:36,235
am through a bit of serendipity

666
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:38,545
came across a ronan and we began

667
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:41,545
working together on this project and so

668
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:43,675
over to ronan to explain a bit

669
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,495
about sam how he went about this

670
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:47,990
and i'm going to advance the slides

671
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:49,885
be ronan such as tommy i'll go

672
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:50,896
to the first one then tommy went

673
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:51,745
and move along

674
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,305
that looks perfect the central room mature

675
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:59,395
guilty for preparing all lisa all this

676
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:03,265
walk i saw ye are many many

677
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:04,525
things to to sir

678
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,945
i think the first thing to mention

679
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:08,564
is that

680
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,425
this is thus been to me where

681
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:14,335
do your projects that's really motivated me

682
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:16,075
a lot because it started by your

683
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:18,625
training saw the team of coach he

684
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,605
has me to come in the uk

685
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:23,905
and come and train from the gym

686
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:26,395
so i took my backpack off a

687
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:29,035
flight from france throughout the uk and

688
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:29,785
i try not to

689
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,365
for about three days it was sweet

690
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:34,135
i don't come over to israel or

691
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:37,135
five days but it's swayed the kind

692
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:38,695
of project which is where they are

693
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:41,155
transforming you are as a nationalism because

694
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,125
it's a project which really doesn't look

695
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,075
like any others it's not like a

696
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:48,175
public website on which you can download

697
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,945
and you can easily guess

698
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,955
and fine with all the different that

699
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,305
i collect from the point that you

700
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:55,615
need to implement healing the case of

701
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:58,555
the rub project the first thing i

702
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:00,175
learn about is that it was using

703
00:27:00,175 --> 00:27:02,035
your appear to be from on but

704
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:04,045
they didn't know which was a coded

705
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:09,235
meter the developer of the website or

706
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:10,105
so british

707
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,105
urgency based in india also it wasn't

708
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:14,935
er like i was talking to to

709
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,675
courteous tried to work and get equal

710
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:18,927
input among the different a and cut

711
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:20,245
that out that they wanted it was

712
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:25,495
weird ica the three portage project so

713
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:28,645
the technology is named coordinator and i

714
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:30,265
wasn't very scared about that

715
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:33,053
technology coordinator they did annoy just weren't

716
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,255
on the phone with such a design

717
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:35,665
and find out it was appear to

718
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,125
be framework from this a new era

719
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,135
did it means a project that i

720
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,663
cannot put my certified and on but

721
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,085
though would love to give a recommendation

722
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:48,085
to a third party companies to setup

723
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,335
a project the litter

724
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,035
the dev company which means for me

725
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:56,245
project management in terms of analytics projects

726
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:57,558
it means that they really need it

727
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:59,605
where the structure my project in order

728
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:01,375
for them to know what the need

729
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:04,615
to implement and i needed to ensure

730
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,295
as well that gets she and her

731
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:10,165
team could clearly see understand what we're

732
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:10,465
going to

733
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:12,835
employment and that it will line with

734
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:15,685
everything that getty as mentioned before which

735
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:17,635
on the the need that the delve

736
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:20,845
into of data collection for this research

737
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:23,665
project so the key aspect of the

738
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:26,305
project as getty assure to you a

739
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:29,575
few pages it's i think maximum between

740
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,745
fifteen to twenty

741
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,145
pages so it seemed like oh that's

742
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:36,295
an easy project but with a lot

743
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:39,805
in terms of that collection so you

744
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:42,625
have a lot of edwin striking coverage

745
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:46,525
for illnesses series including the measurement of

746
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:50,245
evans including the use of custom dimensions

747
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:50,905
to save lives

748
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:52,405
will visit level

749
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:57,595
information lit up and do as well

750
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,505
we quickly saw it or use irish

751
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:02,755
so the possibility to know who is

752
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:06,775
the individual letter was making those different

753
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:08,095
choices

754
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:11,575
we make the choices to go forget

755
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,585
that tally also two jews met and

756
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,675
we're talking mature because the irish was

757
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:18,805
to have something which was really consistent

758
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:21,025
cause the thing is that we have

759
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,845
luqman not many pages but all those

760
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,085
pages are critical and if we were

761
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:29,035
going without death earlier

762
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:31,225
so to say if i was thinking

763
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:33,055
and then the project by just asking

764
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:33,385
too

765
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:37,135
the container on all the page and

766
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:39,715
then decide to use by itself scrapping

767
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:43,105
or either use automatically and the lets

768
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:45,685
her do the tag manager to collect

769
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:48,357
the different a point i chances that

770
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:50,882
in the meantime the death company will

771
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,495
make changes to the dome of the

772
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:54,577
page and everything would have exploded and

773
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:54,745
they

774
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:56,635
would love to redo the full data

775
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,825
collection so that was the reason why

776
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:01,345
we design only consistent that a year

777
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:03,927
which have been implemented directly by the

778
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,385
deaf company in order to ensure that

779
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,665
if something breaks and download data collection

780
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:11,485
i was and the person responsible of

781
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:13,465
a screengrab the data collection and of

782
00:30:13,465 --> 00:30:14,697
course it gave

783
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:18,417
more responsibility and involve more of the

784
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:18,865
the

785
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:22,285
the the deft him a which was

786
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,415
really the the right solution in this

787
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:26,782
specific project because i kind of have

788
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,765
the m on the source code so

789
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,855
those points are really critical and this

790
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:34,165
is really where we unit this is

791
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,195
more like project management and analytics system

792
00:30:37,195 --> 00:30:40,105
brazil then led to another

793
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,895
at doing read all the walking in

794
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,535
on the platform and we really need

795
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:49,685
as well to have a clear quality

796
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:55,475
assessment process because as katyushas it's the

797
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:57,905
rap project is a place where people

798
00:30:57,905 --> 00:30:58,235
are

799
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,809
all the rings was entered making some

800
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,335
poor choice because the the product out

801
00:31:03,335 --> 00:31:05,512
for free but they are making us

802
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:09,155
some orders and it's ones you make

803
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,915
up and although you cannot order back

804
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,735
the different elements so it means that

805
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,435
we didn't want all the time to

806
00:31:17,915 --> 00:31:19,505
go to catchy and silky

807
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:21,125
we make some order in order to

808
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,015
test or data collection please could you

809
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,355
remove us from the system and we

810
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:27,725
have to to make another order again

811
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:29,435
in order to test the platform so

812
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:31,385
that's why we we need it when

813
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,785
you have a clear project management system

814
00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:36,035
in which we can ensure okay here

815
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:38,675
the tracking code has been implemented over

816
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:39,665
here we tested it

817
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:41,675
walks forecasts with ticking the box ways

818
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:43,295
he doesn't walk and then we go

819
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:44,525
back to the deaf team in order

820
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:46,235
to ask for a new implementation

821
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:49,895
and the other point which was of

822
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:52,595
critical importance was the use of custom

823
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:55,595
dimension so to set two other and

824
00:31:55,745 --> 00:31:57,965
additional data which were not collected by

825
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:01,565
default within maximo to each individual so

826
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:04,625
as the use of the premium feature

827
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:06,723
in custom report which was one of

828
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:07,505
critical input

829
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,655
buttons because as we just saw it's

830
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:13,805
the need of data is is big

831
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,685
a task to be crossed with different

832
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:19,085
dimensions so this is where the use

833
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:22,265
of custom dimensions was of critical importance

834
00:32:22,745 --> 00:32:25,475
and i'm okay for them then for

835
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:27,665
the slide okay so

836
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,795
the next one is the way that

837
00:32:29,795 --> 00:32:32,075
we decided to to walk so this

838
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,682
is the project management but this walk

839
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:37,505
has been reviewed by a colleague of

840
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,665
mine that that you know who made

841
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:40,985
the conference as well named for the

842
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:44,075
lifestyle and this is the way we

843
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:46,985
walk with with the urgency sweet consisted

844
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:47,825
of me

845
00:32:47,825 --> 00:32:52,205
myself drafting this document reviewed by you

846
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:55,048
may critique frederick in order to have

847
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:58,445
a document which is listing what the

848
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:00,875
data leader is about and then showing

849
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,965
this document to the team of catchy

850
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:05,555
and to explain to the gym of

851
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,925
katy what what this is all about

852
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,395
because that's clearly not the kind of

853
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,105
thing that you see within the matter

854
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,815
was the recommendation here we are more

855
00:33:12,815 --> 00:33:15,575
looking at the project management document made

856
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:17,735
by an analyst and which as well

857
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:21,455
itself in terms of transparency with the

858
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:23,855
techy tema for them in order to

859
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:27,665
see if okay this is the engagement

860
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:30,095
that we took together you add the

861
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:33,905
responsibilities of deploying the code which is

862
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:36,485
on the column number of let's say

863
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:38,555
fifty five for you which his name

864
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:41,165
cut to bushman direction is made here

865
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:42,575
as you can see you can clearly

866
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:45,065
see the the data layer which was

867
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,895
implemented so in our case it was

868
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:48,305
for every step

869
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:51,005
btw of the older made by the

870
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:53,945
user a wicked person ever to matter

871
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:55,955
more and as i previously said we

872
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:59,405
add for this tracking cut to be

873
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,595
consistent so that's why we decided to

874
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:04,066
use up that idea and in the

875
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,915
last coloring of this document you can

876
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:08,465
clearly see that says our recommendation

877
00:34:08,495 --> 00:34:10,205
which is in our case that did

878
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:13,895
that other yale wasn't implemented properly so

879
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:17,225
please review on this given page that

880
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,205
you have when including this given piece

881
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,373
of code on the button when someone

882
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,945
is pressing it so we're here to

883
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,895
understand how to deal with such a

884
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:28,355
big project it's where they like project

885
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:28,625
manage

886
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,844
she meant before all that that's the

887
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:33,005
master that's the most important they have

888
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,715
to precise as well one thing that

889
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:37,373
we make some choices we've we've got

890
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:39,485
she and asked him not to go

891
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,764
for the e-commerce tracking could suggest to

892
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:43,355
let you know as well that when

893
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:44,855
you deal with such a project you

894
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:47,675
have some choices to make because as

895
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:48,784
we saw you

896
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:50,768
user can make some orders but does

897
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:53,735
calder and are not paid orders so

898
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:54,965
we had the choice to go is

899
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:57,125
up for e-commerce tracking code either to

900
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,045
go for the event tracking code and

901
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:00,665
we decided to go for the event

902
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,335
one because it was like more justified

903
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:06,215
too afraid rozelle done a thing to

904
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:08,945
create some additional data will not exist

905
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:11,705
anger within the system such as that

906
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:14,765
said that the tax amount such as

907
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:17,735
the or the price such as the

908
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,165
transactional although that canvassing

909
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:23,585
and i'm good for the spot

910
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:28,175
the next one is i kind of

911
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:31,115
do similar seeing the big difference is

912
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:32,585
that under the previous

913
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,518
i slice a tie was that we

914
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:39,095
were showing it was about sam

915
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,425
valuables that we are inserting within the

916
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:44,645
day on this one this is another

917
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:46,833
method that we use we the tag

918
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:49,295
manager which is the push event method

919
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:51,995
which consist of sending custom event to

920
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:53,765
the dollar yearly know they'll fight to

921
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:57,125
react on the interaction of the of

922
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,045
the visitor and as well as his

923
00:35:59,045 --> 00:35:59,525
hobby

924
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:01,595
sixty to two hundred

925
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,925
ok i'm good for this one

926
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:08,855
okay and last but not least up

927
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:11,735
this a slide show in fact ordered

928
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:14,315
a different valuable so those are all

929
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:19,145
the different needs that we at least

930
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:21,665
with with catfish and ask for a

931
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:24,635
validation to see if there was any

932
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,105
data which we are missing

933
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,945
out of this list and on some

934
00:36:29,975 --> 00:36:31,925
very dated of course this is this

935
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:33,335
is what we implemented but he on

936
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:35,525
small what we are showing is is

937
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:38,225
read project management parties that says a

938
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,905
lot of needs from the client but

939
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:41,315
we need at some point to to

940
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:42,665
put a limit and say okay we

941
00:36:42,665 --> 00:36:46,085
don't need extra more data do we

942
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:46,385
agree

943
00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:49,085
read that this list is the limit

944
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:51,995
and you only need dos and if

945
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:54,275
yes of course this is kind of

946
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:56,795
what is finally defining the the final

947
00:36:56,825 --> 00:36:59,075
price that's the analysis will put an

948
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,555
undercooked meats and and as well yes

949
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:04,805
i'm good with disliked i think that

950
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,305
was the last oh yeah oh

951
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,825
and that's as well a critical path

952
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:11,765
to offer the of the the project

953
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:14,405
and that i really loved in it

954
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:16,685
is that said during the training i

955
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:19,235
showed to kaddish and asked him how

956
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:22,595
to deal with the custom reports feature

957
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,625
of mathml and i have been surprised

958
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:26,435
to see it it's

959
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:29,345
when i came some days after or

960
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:31,775
weeks after implementation with the rap project

961
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:34,325
that a lot of custom reports were

962
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:36,215
created and that's a good sign of

963
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,825
the training walks and now people have

964
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:40,505
the solution wedding then then they are

965
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:43,295
creating as many custom reporters as they

966
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:45,275
can and here you can clearly see

967
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:46,415
hold the

968
00:37:46,925 --> 00:37:50,855
custom reports really immense the the data

969
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:53,135
which were in the system of mathml

970
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:54,383
because here we got to use the

971
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:57,605
id with the different components that

972
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:01,025
he chews and the date at which

973
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:04,865
the individual decided to pick up the

974
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,935
product i think i have one state

975
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,385
left

976
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:11,525
yes and here is another one in

977
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:13,235
those a report which is really showing

978
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:15,635
for each individual what are the different

979
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:17,771
components and you can clearly see that

980
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:21,545
underlying number one and from london but

981
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:24,575
want to line number for the individual

982
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,555
decided to pick up all the components

983
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,625
but line number five false

984
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,935
some reason this individual decided to not

985
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:32,855
pick up all the different components which

986
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,225
was one of the needs which was

987
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,745
requested from this research which is about

988
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,085
okay what are the different choices that

989
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,375
people are making

990
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:44,675
and a sink can good for my

991
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:48,905
slides yep executive okay thanks rain so

992
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:50,910
and in the last section for that

993
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,195
q and a i just present some

994
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:56,525
early insights from data collection site from

995
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:58,175
the customer reports that biden was just

996
00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:01,025
talking about with financial analyst already we

997
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:02,705
haven't finished cutting out eighty

998
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:04,592
cats and just a few months into

999
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,295
the project say we haven't let evidently

1000
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:08,405
we will be able to land by

1001
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:09,815
the end pop i'll show you what

1002
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:10,685
we've got so far

1003
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:14,915
say this just how i use the

1004
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:18,365
dayton and what swanky past amazed to

1005
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:20,555
think bouts and the flow of people

1006
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:22,205
through the website in order to sort

1007
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:24,531
of see why the thanksgiving wrong and

1008
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:26,675
then the website and sending these kind

1009
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:29,825
of attending tape before of awful trials

1010
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,815
i think that might be at least

1011
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:31,985
eighty people to drop out ice

1012
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:33,995
pretty sad that the non used usage

1013
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:37,385
attrition i talked about before so i'm

1014
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:40,745
ninety one people at the point at

1015
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,625
which i downloaded the data from the

1016
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:46,205
customer reports at that point be randomized

1017
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:48,425
to wrap second to top the two

1018
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:52,295
different arms and the randomisation and i'm

1019
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:55,505
of those fifty six people clicked on

1020
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:57,155
the links i told you about how

1021
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:58,625
our software read captain

1022
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:02,795
send an invite to everybody and inviting

1023
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,785
him to go to one or two

1024
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:06,005
different websites say this is ninety one

1025
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:08,795
people sent the invite to wrapped and

1026
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:10,385
fifty six them clicked on the link

1027
00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:11,915
i went through to the website and

1028
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,825
everybody still not despite us incentivizing them

1029
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:16,595
with a voucher

1030
00:40:17,945 --> 00:40:19,625
and so it lost thirty five at

1031
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,695
that point and then we when they

1032
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:23,495
first land on the website they have

1033
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:27,785
to create a profile and i'm register

1034
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,525
so i'm

1035
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:33,485
and then they also complete some tailoring

1036
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:36,395
question se the ones that determine how

1037
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:37,985
many of the components of the six

1038
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:41,008
components that they get saved between and

1039
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,785
then landing on the website and creating

1040
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,765
a profile we've lost just two people

1041
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:46,385
in that stage of competing the tailoring

1042
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:48,635
question so i was a little bit

1043
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:50,705
concerned that this ten questions in title

1044
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,655
it might get a little irritated by

1045
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:55,325
that sort of section but and if

1046
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:56,855
i lost to their side that's quite

1047
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:57,785
good sign for me

1048
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:01,655
then we've got registration and being complete

1049
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:04,925
and in between that stage and oops

1050
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:08,495
sorry and visiting the home page we've

1051
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:10,115
last night but a site that's another

1052
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:11,735
good sign that that how the host

1053
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,895
ages working while sabic is concerned rarely

1054
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:16,145
is peep the email that is encouraging

1055
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:17,285
people to go visit in the first

1056
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:18,965
place pups is

1057
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:20,795
a bit boring and and doesn't sell

1058
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:23,345
the website very well and although natal

1059
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:24,815
contents kind of difficult to do that

1060
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,075
because we can't spell out the things

1061
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:28,985
awkward about the intervention website and very

1062
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:30,485
easily in that context but we could

1063
00:41:30,485 --> 00:41:31,325
perhaps try harder

1064
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:37,355
and the next slide so i'm ronan

1065
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:39,935
was talking about people been assigned different

1066
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:42,935
components and and i mentioned how this

1067
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:45,245
up to six different ones so we

1068
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:47,585
were interested in knowing about the portion

1069
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:48,999
of people that were going to get

1070
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:51,119
assigned def different numbers of them because

1071
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,384
when we started out the study we

1072
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,565
really

1073
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,575
didn't didn't know that so they asked

1074
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:56,495
these questions ten questions at the start

1075
00:41:56,495 --> 00:41:58,835
the website and depending on their answers

1076
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:01,235
doug assigned either all the six of

1077
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:02,615
them or just the one of them

1078
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:05,015
is with a minimum of one and

1079
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,485
and this is how it's worked out

1080
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:08,075
so no one's had just one even

1081
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:09,695
though that's a possibility and then very

1082
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,525
few people have had two three or

1083
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:12,725
four components

1084
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:15,545
most people have either been assigned five

1085
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:19,295
or six components and so that's useful

1086
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:20,525
in terms of helping us plan for

1087
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:21,695
the main trial that helps us to

1088
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,495
work out resource need cause some of

1089
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:25,265
the components lately while you're there ordering

1090
00:42:25,265 --> 00:42:26,825
something has a cost associated with that

1091
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:27,755
sounds really useful

1092
00:42:31,775 --> 00:42:34,475
and and then i explain that there

1093
00:42:34,475 --> 00:42:35,765
were three different things that people could

1094
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:36,995
ordered and i showed you the sample

1095
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:39,125
box that the website page relating to

1096
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,105
that so this is the box with

1097
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:42,815
twelve different types of condoms to try

1098
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,365
out in it so fifty four people

1099
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:47,915
were assigned the sample box in total

1100
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:48,965
that's every

1101
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:50,105
one he went to the website cause

1102
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:52,625
everyone gets sample box by default so

1103
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,815
fifty four were given that and then

1104
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,065
so on that main page where you've

1105
00:42:57,065 --> 00:42:58,925
got the six different boxes that you

1106
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:00,305
can click on or take you through

1107
00:43:00,305 --> 00:43:02,555
to the relevant page fifty four people

1108
00:43:02,555 --> 00:43:03,605
have seen the one for the sampler

1109
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:05,735
box and forty eight of them have

1110
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:07,115
actually clicked on that and gone to

1111
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:08,912
visit that page we've just lost six

1112
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:09,125
that

1113
00:43:09,155 --> 00:43:13,385
point which is not bad and then

1114
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:15,185
earn between visting not paid and then

1115
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:17,345
placing an order with last eleven people

1116
00:43:17,435 --> 00:43:19,235
that's eleven people may he just didn't

1117
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:20,435
like the look of it and just

1118
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:22,115
thought that wasn't really for them but

1119
00:43:22,115 --> 00:43:24,215
that's an assumption but something pops to

1120
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:26,225
speak to people later in the study

1121
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:28,535
and we've come to our interviews and

1122
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:29,285
then and

1123
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,635
those who then click to go through

1124
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:32,735
to the next page thus progressing making

1125
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,325
an order chosen what box they want

1126
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:35,735
more insight they want which has lost

1127
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:38,075
one person and then we lost two

1128
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,515
on the next page between the point

1129
00:43:39,515 --> 00:43:42,005
to and say not second page naturally

1130
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:45,185
placing the order so and yeah was

1131
00:43:45,185 --> 00:43:46,835
quite pleased that i chose sway that

1132
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:48,484
process of ordering is quite smooth and

1133
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:49,205
straightforward

1134
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:52,025
perhaps not no one's experiencing technical problems

1135
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,215
or issues with usability around the ordering

1136
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:54,935
process

1137
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,445
unreal it's the same pitcher with condom

1138
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:01,299
ordering say forty nine people or that

1139
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:02,525
are not going to ensure that the

1140
00:44:02,645 --> 00:44:04,085
numbers on this one base the same

1141
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:06,395
pattern that we've lost just as a

1142
00:44:06,425 --> 00:44:08,465
handful of star who never festering that

1143
00:44:08,465 --> 00:44:11,795
page and then and dutch ordering seems

1144
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:13,565
to be fairly straightforward for everybody

1145
00:44:14,705 --> 00:44:15,965
and the same with ordering the condom

1146
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:16,925
carrier as well

1147
00:44:19,595 --> 00:44:21,635
and then the three different types of

1148
00:44:21,635 --> 00:44:22,985
video that people can go and say

1149
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:24,185
i'm just going to do one slide

1150
00:44:24,185 --> 00:44:25,085
on one of the videos which is

1151
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:27,065
the demo demo video that showed you

1152
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:29,675
it's a completely different picture here so

1153
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:32,675
for seven people allocated this video and

1154
00:44:32,825 --> 00:44:35,165
but only sixteen actually clicked on that

1155
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:36,755
box to go visit the demo page

1156
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:38,165
that's telling us that that ho

1157
00:44:38,285 --> 00:44:41,135
page is not selling this demo video

1158
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:42,905
at all if i'm going to click

1159
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,375
on it while only sixteen above or

1160
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:48,425
seventy it and and then only of

1161
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:50,375
those sixteen opens only safa notch then

1162
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,355
when i had to click on the

1163
00:44:52,535 --> 00:44:55,805
video imply it and then nobody watched

1164
00:44:55,805 --> 00:44:57,545
it in full on the meantime it's

1165
00:44:57,545 --> 00:44:58,325
by watching the video

1166
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:01,775
i was seventeen seconds so not attractive

1167
00:45:01,788 --> 00:45:03,095
able to go and visit it when

1168
00:45:03,095 --> 00:45:04,295
i do go visit the page not

1169
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:06,575
playing it very much and not many

1170
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:07,865
people playing it and then when they

1171
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:11,190
do disengaging quite quickly so they got

1172
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:12,125
quite a bit of work to do

1173
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,865
on the video and the demo video

1174
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:15,275
but the same picture is true of

1175
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:16,865
the other types of videos as well

1176
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:19,025
they only looking at

1177
00:45:20,495 --> 00:45:22,955
and so what we've learned while we've

1178
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:24,455
learned that we can use analytics data

1179
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:27,845
to gain some important insights into non

1180
00:45:27,845 --> 00:45:29,945
usage attrition and we've just started to

1181
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:30,904
kind of touch the surface with the

1182
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:33,125
data we've got already and we're going

1183
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,565
to use us to make some improvements

1184
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,295
so and my conclusions have a kind

1185
00:45:37,295 --> 00:45:39,725
of touch support arm touched upon already

1186
00:45:39,725 --> 00:45:40,325
are the

1187
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:42,545
the home page as attracting users to

1188
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:44,645
fit it up the first three components

1189
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:46,475
the things that you can order a

1190
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:48,515
month on those component pages that good

1191
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,825
conversion to ordering that seems to be

1192
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:53,765
no issues with the ordering process and

1193
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:55,505
but the homepages not attracting people to

1194
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:59,503
visit the video content and and those

1195
00:45:59,503 --> 00:46:00,005
speedo

1196
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:02,405
component pages are also not working very

1197
00:46:02,405 --> 00:46:03,755
well to encourage users to watch the

1198
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:05,225
videos when they're already there and the

1199
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:06,905
videos aren't be watched very long so

1200
00:46:06,995 --> 00:46:08,705
the first few seconds i encourage people

1201
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:09,275
to carry on

1202
00:46:10,422 --> 00:46:12,125
am and we still have lots and

1203
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,955
lots to learn about this failed and

1204
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:16,805
what is really possible intense analytics so

1205
00:46:16,895 --> 00:46:19,445
i am very much a newbie in

1206
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:19,835
this

1207
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:22,625
and situation

1208
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:27,035
i am ona solution for linking an

1209
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:31,655
individual level and up that the user

1210
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:33,725
id that we collecting invite cap for

1211
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:35,765
all our surveys and test and sai

1212
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:38,825
testing and linking that to our individuals

1213
00:46:38,825 --> 00:46:40,235
as they go through to the two

1214
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:43,145
different websites who collects analytics data that

1215
00:46:43,145 --> 00:46:43,895
process that ronan

1216
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:46,205
worked out for us am by liaising

1217
00:46:46,205 --> 00:46:48,125
with with us and also at our

1218
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:50,135
development companies as was what really one

1219
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:51,935
has been successful had no problems with

1220
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:53,945
gathering the the unique user id of

1221
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,715
everyone in a matter moab and seeing

1222
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:58,865
what the wrongdoing and crises customer reports

1223
00:46:58,865 --> 00:47:00,695
and gathering all that data from that

1224
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:03,155
swill worked really well and that means

1225
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,085
can be possible for us to

1226
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:06,365
measure dose in our main trial amd

1227
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:08,705
in quite a fine grained way she's

1228
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:10,895
really useful and and we're just beginning

1229
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,085
to think about how we'll calculate a

1230
00:47:13,235 --> 00:47:15,455
set of standardized score for everybody in

1231
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,495
our trial at an individual level based

1232
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:20,045
on the products that are allocated and

1233
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:22,775
ordered and also which videos to watch

1234
00:47:22,775 --> 00:47:23,795
and how long for

1235
00:47:25,745 --> 00:47:29,255
so that's the end of the presentation

1236
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:31,235
them so just like to acknowledge off

1237
00:47:31,235 --> 00:47:33,665
under the national institute for health research

1238
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:34,895
and all of the team working on

1239
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:35,854
this with me as while at the

1240
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:39,425
university of hertfordshire and others and am

1241
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:40,625
yet onto any questions

1242
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,945
thank you very much a catfish six

1243
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,485
euros for the sir griffith presentation i'm

1244
00:47:48,485 --> 00:47:50,975
looking at the chart right now we

1245
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:55,235
have approximately let's say maximum five minutes

1246
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:57,305
because of those i was a talker

1247
00:47:57,635 --> 00:48:00,095
at four pm just pick the first

1248
00:48:00,095 --> 00:48:01,115
one which isn't

1249
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:04,655
which was the most useful met him

1250
00:48:04,655 --> 00:48:07,145
with tunes use during this project

1251
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:13,205
ah roney my view on this but

1252
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:14,884
for me as both a masterpiece in

1253
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:16,505
the right times but was the em

1254
00:48:16,595 --> 00:48:19,895
the custom id and then also the

1255
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:22,505
reports as well when the report says

1256
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:24,095
and then i go into all the

1257
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:26,285
time now to to look at to

1258
00:48:26,285 --> 00:48:28,175
gather the data to help me understand

1259
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:28,325
the

1260
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:31,085
usability of the website and unauthorised i've

1261
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:33,755
just presented with those flowcharts all comes

1262
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:35,135
from those custom reports

1263
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,055
and i'm looking at the chart those

1264
00:48:40,055 --> 00:48:42,095
not a question but small dickey with

1265
00:48:42,107 --> 00:48:44,135
logistic which is about though would it

1266
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:47,015
be possible to download the presentation i

1267
00:48:47,015 --> 00:48:49,025
mean will it be possible for you

1268
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,065
to send it to i mean do

1269
00:48:51,065 --> 00:48:52,925
you allow me to share it with

1270
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:55,055
the audience or would you like to

1271
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:56,375
keep the presentation

1272
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:58,235
for yourself or can it be

1273
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:01,835
ronan yea i'm happy for anyone to

1274
00:49:01,835 --> 00:49:05,525
have it stolen identity oh yeah well

1275
00:49:05,615 --> 00:49:08,945
one sinker of it my mailbox just

1276
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,475
to make it as a pdf and

1277
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:13,115
then and then surely to shooting back

1278
00:49:14,165 --> 00:49:18,935
hmm i lit the audience write downs

1279
00:49:18,995 --> 00:49:21,215
the last question with the level itself

1280
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:22,445
four minutes left

1281
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:24,665
do you have for example any any

1282
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:26,645
questions or get you that you like

1283
00:49:26,645 --> 00:49:28,715
me to ask you for an audience

1284
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,045
or

1285
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:30,755
penny

1286
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:33,635
do i what sorry i'll do you

1287
00:49:33,635 --> 00:49:35,555
have any any questions for you i

1288
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,505
mean do you ever any question that

1289
00:49:37,505 --> 00:49:39,215
you would have expect the audience to

1290
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:40,805
ask you for and that led me

1291
00:49:40,805 --> 00:49:41,225
to us

1292
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:45,785
or do i have any questions and

1293
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,725
i suppose the thing that i'm still

1294
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:54,875
struggling with the most is

1295
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:58,595
is linking all the data in the

1296
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,835
customer report so each each custom report

1297
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:04,175
i can download the data as an

1298
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:06,875
excel file so for example if we're

1299
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,525
talking about the components allocates i can

1300
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,265
download it so i've got one column

1301
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:12,695
which is the user id and then

1302
00:50:12,785 --> 00:50:14,585
noted to have component one yes no

1303
00:50:14,585 --> 00:50:15,965
component to yes now i can

1304
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:18,215
it like that then i can download

1305
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,845
another sapper report that says did they

1306
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:22,535
do

1307
00:50:23,135 --> 00:50:25,355
did they visit the sample pack page

1308
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:27,485
for example now be a completely separate

1309
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:30,035
one and so at the moment they're

1310
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:32,585
all very separate like that and then

1311
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:35,195
i have to combine them all together

1312
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:40,115
so i suppose oh and also every

1313
00:50:40,115 --> 00:50:42,305
time i want to update the data

1314
00:50:43,355 --> 00:50:44,855
i i it's not easy as pie

1315
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,805
can use date i suppose but i

1316
00:50:46,805 --> 00:50:49,685
can't just just spell to buy everything

1317
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:51,365
since i last looked in and download

1318
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:53,135
an artisanal happened to just kept kind

1319
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:55,715
of keep manually looking and then updating

1320
00:50:55,715 --> 00:50:56,405
my excel day

1321
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:59,215
islam that so i don't know whether

1322
00:50:59,215 --> 00:51:01,465
it's possible is more question for you

1323
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,505
than the audience rated but this is

1324
00:51:03,505 --> 00:51:05,845
something that i'm i'm struggling most with

1325
00:51:06,145 --> 00:51:09,835
at the moment and and yeah i

1326
00:51:09,835 --> 00:51:11,215
became to know about youth as a

1327
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:13,015
waiter kind of made that process a

1328
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:16,615
bit more straightforward i suppose but my

1329
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,035
biggest the

1330
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:20,575
limits of what matinee can provide nuclear

1331
00:51:21,265 --> 00:51:23,665
grades yeah it'll have the job the

1332
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:25,555
answer i think that er we are

1333
00:51:25,555 --> 00:51:28,375
looking for custom reports with far more

1334
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:29,155
dimensions

1335
00:51:30,265 --> 00:51:32,395
i guess that's the that's the key

1336
00:51:32,395 --> 00:51:35,365
thing here the maximum usually sweet custom

1337
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:37,435
dimension and from what i remember old

1338
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:42,205
yeah everytime you have something i did

1339
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:43,615
my best thing then will flip to

1340
00:51:43,615 --> 00:51:46,105
musicians who can yeah you can just

1341
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:48,055
put up to three custom dimensions then

1342
00:51:48,055 --> 00:51:51,140
filter by some as accustomed i mentioned

1343
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,065
but at the moment i'm not sure

1344
00:51:53,065 --> 00:51:55,135
that desk plans to extend the number

1345
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:57,325
of custom dimension which correspond more to

1346
00:51:57,505 --> 00:51:58,633
what you would like to

1347
00:51:58,795 --> 00:52:01,495
editor of the expedition xl fight and

1348
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:02,935
you would get as many custom they

1349
00:52:02,935 --> 00:52:04,728
mentioned those units were ok they don't

1350
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,505
from both free of up to five

1351
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:09,565
or ten but then you can refer

1352
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:13,375
to them back in excel and alfonso

1353
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,925
says thank you because you insult to

1354
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:17,845
his question about which was the most

1355
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:18,955
useful met matua

1356
00:52:19,555 --> 00:52:22,075
and we don't have any questions left

1357
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:26,605

1358
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:29,725
