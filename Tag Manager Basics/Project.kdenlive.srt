1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,270
today I will go through the

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,750
basics over the Matomo tag manager

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,780
and also the basics of all they're

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,810
getting consent management to work together with

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,300
the matomo tag manager air for those

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,160
interesting in the tracking

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,260
of s p a applications i will

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,290
do that tomorrow ah alright so

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,610
let's look into what this is but

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,470
let's first talk a little bit of

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,350
on me as the introduction said i've

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,390
been working week a analytics since two

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,120
thousand and ten each and i usually

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,135
refer to myself as some kind of

15
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:43,320
a generalists and when it comes to

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,320
web development i started working within the

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,560
web

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,140
the industry around two thousand and has

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,110
had a mix of roles or i'd

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,850
have started off as a friend front

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,810
end developer but

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,840
today i'm more of a business developer

23
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,180
but i still love the coding so

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,070
i can't get my fingers away from

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,670
from the commit messages so to speak

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,620
and so what i usually do on

27
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,890
my daily job is to help our

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,080
clients at the littlest with employ

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,530
lamenting hematoma in their organizations and that

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,658
can be everything from helping out with

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,280
tag management issues or a more technical

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,089
deep dives or educating or training developers

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,170
or whatever that needs to learn about

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,100
moto mod soul who are digitally well

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,240
where digital practice

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,670
agency that loves open source i think

37
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,920
we've been contributing to different open source

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,290
projects since two thousand and five

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,730
under our main project to contribute to

40
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,530
has been drupal where we are pretty

41
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,900
well known within the drupal community the

42
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,260
seamus but the three four last years

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,360
we've been starting to contribute more and

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,070
more to matter more and we hope

45
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,500
to do much more of that as

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
well as what we offer as a

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,290
the company is of course a sauce

48
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,810
solution for matomo and

49
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:13,590
professional consulting to help people with that

50
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,500
and we're also building and selling premium

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,650
plugins to matomo so that's something we

52
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,190
will hopefully share more news about soon

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,230
i have a presentation about one of

54
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,140
them tomorrow called the use of feedback

55
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,020
planet but that's for tomorrow so let's

56
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,200
go

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,710
get into today's topic and that is

58
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,840
tag management tag management isn't super new

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,450
in the matomo world it is but

60
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,960
basically tag management's the attack manager is

61
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,570
a tool that help us structure the

62
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,550
tracking code that we can add to

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,360
a websites

64
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,140
at once we have it installed it

65
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,960
means that we can implement tracking without

66
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,920
actually changing code in our cms system

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,200
or or on the production servers we

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,000
can do that through the tool type

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,440
an id tag manager

70
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,210
why should we use a tag manager

71
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,670
well first of all the gifts of

72
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,890
autonomy and we don't have to depend

73
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,440
on developers or ops team to actually

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,540
implement new tracking and this is actually

75
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,360
a great thing because if you're working

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,550
with tracking it's usually a lot of

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
fasts or

78
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,700
short term jobs we need to apply

79
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,070
we need to maybe meet a campaign

80
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,672
that has a tight deadline or start

81
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:41,730
to track things and continuously improve what

82
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,270
we're doing fatigue management is rate from

83
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,960
that perspective and tag management all again

84
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,630
gives us a better visual strict structure

85
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,970
of what we're doing on our site

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,790
so by using it we can actually

87
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,330
jump between websites and learn pretty well

88
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,731
and understand how things has been in

89
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:07,710
in done and we don't have to

90
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,120
reinvent the wheel over and over

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
again so that means that the air

92
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,390
the quantity will actually be better

93
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,920
and this of course leads to better

94
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,250
security and quality and less loading time

95
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,050
often since we don't even have the

96
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,960
meal there the code that is implemented

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,360
through the documentaries fast and consistent

98
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,020
and of course we can be faster

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,190
with our development and applying youth changes

100
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,090
to our websites

101
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,847
at the concepts of tag management tag

102
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:49,650
management has three components basically we talk

103
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,100
about tags triggers and variables and together

104
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,100
with these three components we can build

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,130
pretty much anything once we start to

106
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,150
learn how it works

107
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,290
first of all triggers are actually connected

108
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,410
to events in browsers so events can

109
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,840
be such a thing as reloading a

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
page clicking on something or if he

111
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,990
uses scrolls or submits a forum or

112
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,300
basically anything that has to be with

113
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,220
interaction on a page or in a

114
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,640
browser

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,920
her tags are the actual code that

116
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,900
we are executing and this can also

117
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,390
be pretty much anything we have predefined

118
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,950
code snippets within the tag manager that

119
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,960
help us for instance to do that

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,500
matomo tracking but at as my example

121
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,800
here in

122
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,650
presentation shows we can basically execute any

123
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,690
type of code like the alert hello

124
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,080
world

125
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,750
finally we can use variables to fetch

126
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,840
data from the page or the browser

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,400
and use that data within our tags

128
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,030
or the triggers to create logic altogether

129
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,280
they create a really really nice way

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,320
to to structure our tracking

131
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,170
so

132
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,590
let's look at the next example

133
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,020
i'm actually gonna demo

134
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,740
how to set up

135
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,400
tracking in motto so i'm going to

136
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,950
go to bhutan was tag manager and

137
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,840
what we're going to look at here

138
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,320
is the defaults setup or form

139
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,310
a page view tracking so to do

140
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,040
that you basically have to click here

141
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,460
to create a new tag you select

142
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,720
at the tag type called matomo analytics

143
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,440
and as i explained before this actually

144
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,420
means that when you click on any

145
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,020
of these

146
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,180
you're getting a pre-written code and if

147
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,670
you click on this tag motto wanna

148
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,800
lyrics i'm actually gonna go back and

149
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,570
click on the one i already created

150
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,430
or you're getting a set of predefined

151
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,130
configurations from this case i'm going to

152
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,720
track it up too

153
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,000
matomo and i'm going to attract page

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,060
views the thing we normally start with

155
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,860
when we we implement a new website

156
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,190
as you can see here i have

157
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,850
been different fetus and i can change

158
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,190
and configure but in this case we're

159
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,620
doing it really easy and that the

160
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,480
second thing i need to do here

161
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,410
is to tell

162
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,680
the matomo tag when you're when to

163
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,540
execute this code and as you see

164
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,970
here i already selected page view and

165
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,380
if i click on this still about

166
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,300
and i can actually start edit it

167
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,520
and this is a

168
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,330
of course when a bow user reloads

169
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,400
the page i want to send a

170
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,650
new page view to matomo so that

171
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,750
we can track track that we didn't

172
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,380
our website

173
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,680
so it it's pretty simple actually

174
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,992
yeah let's see do we have any

175
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,900
variables yes in moto when we also

176
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,600
have a variable that helps us to

177
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,190
to get the standard data

178
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,290
and add to that that decides what

179
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,540
to send so in this example for

180
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,730
instance we can add

181
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,240
set up things like if i want

182
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:29,580
to disable cookies or if i want

183
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,120
to

184
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,919
sand the beacons are witches are quite

185
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,830
techy and set up but we can

186
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,230
also force requiring a consent here

187
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,200
so this is a pretty nice way

188
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,750
to to start off with so i'm

189
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,490
going to go back to my presentation

190
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,770
and i'm going to talk a little

191
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,450
bit about a more

192
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,610
detailed case which is tracking uses without

193
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,570
asking for consent and the background to

194
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,000
this task which is pretty common is

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,390
that gdp r requires us to ask

196
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,410
for consent

197
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,490
from useless before we start to track

198
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:11,700
them

199
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,080
and that this relates to that gdp

200
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,880
earth is

201
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,310
describing that if you're restoring personal data

202
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,100
or if you do profiling you need

203
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,590
to ask for consent we're looking a

204
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,730
bit too what that really means and

205
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,330
but

206
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,290
yup so so personal data is of

207
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,240
course the ip address in many cases

208
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,510
but but the the reason why when

209
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,268
going to do tracking without consent is

210
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,980
that of course if we stopped to

211
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,460
ask consent from all the users we

212
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,720
will loose a lot of data

213
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
depending on where your how your website

214
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,650
is set up

215
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,660
so

216
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,765
interesting interpretation of gdp aren't that many

217
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:09,115
organizations do is that if we implement

218
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,635
cookie free tracking we can actually

219
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:16,945
track users without having the consent

220
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,305
which is of course nice if you

221
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:22,165
if you want to have correct data

222
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,895
on your website so what is actually

223
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,475
profiling in moto mobile when a user

224
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:29,335
visits your website for the first time

225
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:33,505
we set a cookie and that cookie

226
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,365
contains a digital number

227
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:38,035
which is the visitor id

228
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,105
and that

229
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:44,065
id is stored in moto more together

230
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,195
with the data we collect though the

231
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,445
next time a user visits your site

232
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:52,195
a matomo script can find that cookie

233
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,465
and it will actually start adding data

234
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:58,135
to the already created profile in matomo

235
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,138
so that we're building a profile in

236
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:01,405
in

237
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:04,495
in matomo it looks like this if

238
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,725
you if you look into it in

239
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:07,315
the interface so you can see here

240
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,625
like there's the visit number one and

241
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,715
basic number two and the data collected

242
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,955
from that user is stored to the

243
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:19,020
same profile and this is what gdp

244
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,145
year talks about that your it requires

245
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:21,565
a console

246
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,545
sent if you started to do that

247
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,085
so the solution is of course to

248
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:30,775
not do profiling and that means that

249
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,385
whenever use envisages the first time we're

250
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:36,745
not setting persistent cookies meaning the data

251
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:40,225
stored in matomo is connected to efficient

252
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,725
cooking only so the next

253
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,795
time to use it gets there we

254
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:46,045
don't have any persistent cookie that can

255
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:48,475
connect that id add to any previous

256
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,565
visits so we create a new profile

257
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:54,595
in matomo and this is actually the

258
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,545
definition of of profiling

259
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,415
so we can avoid that through having

260
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:04,618
a matomo to not set these cookies

261
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,345
so let's look into how to do

262
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:07,885
this

263
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:11,455
step by step you need to basically

264
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:13,105
disable cookies by default

265
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:18,145
you need to identify the consent and

266
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,965
this is usually happening through the cms

267
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,245
so we need to know if someone

268
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,045
clicked the consent

269
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:28,495
dialog button or button was similar

270
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:31,255
and then we need to have some

271
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:33,475
kind of logic to execute

272
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:37,975
some particular function similar to my will

273
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,355
always show you pretty soon

274
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:44,425
that will if the user has

275
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,875
even a consent we will actually start

276
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:50,065
setting cookies and and the reason we

277
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:51,805
want to set cookies is that

278
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,475
that is because

279
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:59,455
it's sometimes nice to have that extreme

280
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:02,035
for medicine we get from cookies to

281
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:04,585
be able to see recurring visits

282
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:07,855
because if you're using my told me

283
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:12,505
without cookies or persistent cookies basically every

284
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:15,715
user will be reported as a new

285
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:19,165
visitor and when you're starting to analyze

286
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,835
your your your application it's often nice

287
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,496
to know and perhaps create segments of

288
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:25,885
a recall

289
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:28,465
foreign visitors or beast visitors that has

290
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:29,905
been to the site more than ten

291
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,215
times etc so this is of course

292
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:34,405
nice to do if we have the

293
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:36,595
consent so that's the background to to

294
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,065
why we usually want to do this

295
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:38,395
as well

296
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:40,885
so first of all you go to

297
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:44,455
your matomo configuration variable we looked at

298
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,825
it here before it's basically

299
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,935
this little checkbox so we can click

300
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:51,985
disable cookies

301
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:54,715
and we can also

302
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:59,365
and check another checkbox further down now

303
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:02,815
it's a bit up where we're forcing

304
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:05,545
let's see

305
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:20,065
okay now i missed that but this

306
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:20,335
one

307
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:24,115
are actually going to do money sorry

308
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:27,175
for being confusing but we will by

309
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:31,075
disabling cookies like it's the second step

310
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:35,305
is to identify the cookie consent from

311
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:38,305
our cms now i'm looking at the

312
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,725
european commission sites and know

313
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:44,215
normally we have a button like this

314
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:47,905
access accept all cookies and that's the

315
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:50,755
behavior we want to start looking into

316
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:51,265
so

317
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:55,345
when that happens we want to identify

318
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,835
this somehow and to do so i

319
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:00,595
usually create a variable that reads that

320
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:05,995
cookie information from the browser and by

321
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:09,925
doing looking create a new logic so

322
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,935
that if the cookie is set to

323
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:12,445
basically

324
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,195
i can

325
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,145
execute that we have a consent given

326
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:21,145
to matomo which is the yes option

327
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,675
down here and when we are doing

328
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:25,645
so not only will start setting cookies

329
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:26,785
and

330
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,785
if we don't have the consent or

331
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:31,165
actually on every

332
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:35,305
other patriots will run the code above

333
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,605
that requires us to get a cookie

334
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,115
consent

335
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:44,274
so that in combination with the attract

336
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:47,065
without cookies will give us the wanted

337
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:47,545
behavior

338
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:50,875
so

339
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,295
let's jump to the next the the

340
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,135
final

341
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,035
step is to do a trigger as

342
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:00,895
i said that if we have a

343
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:05,605
cookie consent we will execute this little

344
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:09,205
code and let's look at how that

345
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:12,595
that looks in that

346
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,235
so what i have done here is

347
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:18,985
that i ever

348
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:23,125
matomo configuration variable as we looked into

349
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,095
before where i have disabled cookies

350
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,925
i also created a tag

351
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:35,665
for several tags the first one is

352
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:39,715
require consent this one will always be

353
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:43,765
executed and the only thing it does

354
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,345
is to run accustomed javascript saying require

355
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:47,005
consent

356
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,695
the second logic if that

357
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:53,335
if

358
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:58,315
consent is given which might trigger i

359
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:01,405
talked about is here i'm going to

360
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:06,175
execute this code remember cookie consent given

361
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:09,865
and the trigger i configured in this

362
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:10,435
case

363
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:14,905
if that we're looking at their value

364
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:18,655
from the cookie and this one is

365
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:21,204
actually configured to work with the european

366
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:22,584
commission site and i will show you

367
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:22,915
that

368
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:26,515
in a while it's actually a bit

369
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,115
advanced so looking at this site

370
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:33,895
and i had to go to code

371
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:34,615
inspection

372
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,765
and go to our cookies

373
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:41,665
and there is actually a cookie called

374
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:42,385
c

375
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:47,875
c k one and they have an

376
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,525
array of data in this one so

377
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:52,195
c m equals true means that we

378
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:54,055
have a consent so if i remove

379
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:56,095
this one and reload the page would

380
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:59,185
probably see the cookie consent again so

381
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:00,625
reading this one now

382
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:04,915
we have cm force so as long

383
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,445
as step one is false i will

384
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:10,885
not execute the script cookie consent given

385
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,525
as if the hematoma all are distort

386
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:15,775
stored this i can i can remove

387
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,505
that cookie and hopefully if i reload

388
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,965
the page we can see that we

389
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:21,805
don't get them

390
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:24,385
tormo cookies but as soon as i

391
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:24,985
do that

392
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:27,925
and reload the page

393
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:30,595
we're going to get the matomo cookie

394
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:33,565
consent stored and we're also setting

395
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,295
the persistent cookies

396
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:40,915
from all on this way we're able

397
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:42,025
to to track

398
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,645
the consent and and handle the

399
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,605
the cookie cookie less tracking for uses

400
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,735
that hasn't been giving a consent

401
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,975
let's see

402
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:04,135
so one thing that i can share

403
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:06,535
as well is that i'm not working

404
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:10,045
with the european commission and hopefully helping

405
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:13,435
them with potomac but instead i'm using

406
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:17,125
a dental plugin in my chrome browser

407
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,795
that helped me to simulate tracking on

408
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:20,305
basically

409
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:22,045
any site i would like to play

410
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:24,595
with and the lily plugin is called

411
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:28,015
you sir and your user javascript and

412
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,565
css and if i click this one

413
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,195
i will be i can add and

414
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:37,345
both javascript and css that will be

415
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,745
running in my browser on basically any

416
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,215
site so you can see it connect

417
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:43,345
it's connected to this domain so what

418
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:44,905
i usually do here is that i

419
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,245
go to the tag manager i go

420
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:50,156
to the install code section i grabbed

421
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,325
this javascript

422
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:55,135
i added to the site and then

423
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:58,555
basically press save and by doing so

424
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:00,025
i can also make sure that it's

425
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:01,945
green up here i know that i

426
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:05,665
will always execute this script on this

427
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,705
site so that's a great great way

428
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,895
to assimilate

429
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,950
tracking

430
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,390
let's see

431
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,820
so let's go back to the presentation

432
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,510
yet we looked up the demo and

433
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,720
actually exposed to a pretty quick

434
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,590
demonstration i will do a bit more

435
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,340
advanced

436
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,760
it's a bit more more of an

437
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:41,410
efficient tomorrow displaying how to track single

438
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,050
page application saw right now i'm going

439
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,440
to open up for questions and details

440
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
about this i hope to be able

441
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,120
to share the presentation with you guys

442
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,870
afterwards

443
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,180
so let sir

444
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,120
let's go ahead with questions

445
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,060
yeah thank you if any questions please

446
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,900
let them know

447
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,932
so that they glossed over because of

448
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:08,080
them

449
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,880
okay seems to be quite quiet no

450
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,260
get one question maybe

451
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,890
okay where to disable cookies good

452
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,480
so when you go into the tag

453
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,680
manager you usually have a variable called

454
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,250
the moto m all a conflagration

455
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,360
and when you edit that one i

456
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,380
scroll down and you will find this

457
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,540
little checkbox disable cookies

458
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,920
well maybe i should do this actually

459
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,280
from scratch that's actually i'm actually going

460
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,470
to create a new tag manager container

461
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,050
and just do it from an empty

462
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,740
container

463
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,770
so you can follow it step by

464
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,130
step

465
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,820
so now i have a totally empty

466
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,970
tag manager so what i usually start

467
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,270
with is to create a tomo tracking

468
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,880
tag so i want to crap track

469
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,810
page views

470
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,536
i'm not going to do much more

471
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,200
not now but before normally hear you

472
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,980
select that the atomic confirmation variable solid

473
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:12,880
click on this one

474
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,150
this will actually bring up a new

475
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:21,070
variable and pretty much everything prefilled i

476
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,900
would check the disabled cookies

477
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,930
and i will scroll down and just

478
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,110
creates a variable so now my page

479
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,840
view tag is connected to the atomic

480
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,950
configuration variable

481
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,620
the last thing i need to do

482
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,360
is to create the trigger

483
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,720
i will click on page view because

484
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,270
that's when i want to fire and

485
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,360
created so basically

486
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,750
and i need to create a tag

487
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,130
so if i published if i can

488
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,810
keep it to version of one

489
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,640
i basically have patriots running so we

490
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,510
have a tag

491
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,040
executing that i have a trigger or

492
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,703
page use and in this case i

493
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:11,554
only have one variable containing the moto

494
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,680
configuration so if i install this code

495
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:14,980
now

496
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,270
and go back to my european commission

497
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,644
page and with the change to javascript

498
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,610
or use up to remove the script

499
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,210
tags

500
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,210
and we can save it

501
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,630
so to see that it really works

502
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,180
now i need to go to my

503
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,030
network tired and i usually shelter my

504
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,820
ip address and when i reload this

505
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,440
one i can see that we have

506
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,110
a moto mod pizza pie called and

507
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,760
an action name so i can actually

508
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,801
see that this one is sending data

509
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:48,370
to matomo

510
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:52,630
but a cookie store links i need

511
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,000
to remove this one time reloaded again

512
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,440
yes so right now we disabled cookies

513
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,550
for all users

514
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,450
and the next step would be to

515
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:05,680
yeah

516
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,280
the seat

517
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:22,750
just lost my screener okay the next

518
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,340
step would be to

519
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,790
create a variable that looks at this

520
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,210
cookie

521
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,770
so let's create that variable we create

522
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,510
the variable of the type

523
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,620
or are we the first party cookie

524
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,990
i'm going to go back to my

525
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,640
site and the cook i want to

526
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,580
look for is this one cck one

527
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,760
you're just going to name it like

528
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,160
that and this is where we're actually

529
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,280
name of the the cookie i'm going

530
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,030
to look into

531
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,330
and this cookie in this case it

532
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,090
always exists if you had a simple

533
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:01,990
solution that

534
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,350
a lot of sites have cookies that

535
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,860
either they exist or not and if

536
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,110
that's the solution you have you can

537
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,380
actually set a default value here to

538
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,440
not set at won't matter right now

539
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,630
because these cookies always but if you

540
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,670
do that you can use that in

541
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,260
your logic for the cheddar later

542
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,510
m and some will actually write it

543
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,420
like that so first of all now

544
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,250
we will read that cookie on the

545
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,790
page

546
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,050
the next thing i need to do

547
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,740
is to require the cookie consent so

548
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,200
that said java scripts and i'm going

549
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,440
to

550
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,500
shall i copy this code from my

551
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,750
other tag mentor instance just now

552
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,610
welcome to the swamp the scammer copied

553
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,780
culture sorry

554
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,940
back so it is the current tag

555
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,710
matter i'm going to create a new

556
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,320
tag of the type custom html

557
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,530
red wire called sam i'm going to

558
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,220
paste

559
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:17,620
the script here required consent i can

560
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,120
then create a trigger

561
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,580
and the trigger i want to use

562
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,150
her is doom ready that's actually bit

563
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,870
before

564
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,640
our page series is triggered to make

565
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,870
sure that we're requiring it before the

566
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,480
patriots sent so creating this tag

567
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,470
now we're requiring consent and the last

568
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,700
thing would be to

569
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,840
set the logic for the consent given

570
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,520
i would show you how that works

571
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,600
and you're just going to copy the

572
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,380
code handwritten

573
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,350
though going back to creating a new

574
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,830
tag

575
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,430
while the type custom html

576
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,490
read ma'am there

577
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,310
even

578
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,120
now replaced it here

579
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,590
and now to the perhaps more tricky

580
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,930
part now need to create this custom

581
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,440
trigger

582
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,160
we're going to do it until i'm

583
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,680
ready and in this case i want

584
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,280
to look at my previously created variables

585
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,740
i'm going can go to custom and

586
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,150
here you find my

587
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,590
a variable called cct one which was

588
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,450
the cookie consent or cookie

589
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,360
so now to the logic

590
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:50,740
corn sunk given that nice solution is

591
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,760
normally too

592
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,760
make it like this if your solution

593
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,620
is that the cookies

594
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:02,770
doesn't exist until you have a consent

595
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,250
he remembered i gave this variable a

596
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,870
default value for if you do it

597
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,820
like this knocked said

598
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,730
so you're actually going to do a

599
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,340
negative logic here so if it doesn't

600
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,080
equal not set we know that we

601
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,200
have a consent but in our example

602
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,750
here they actually the cook crooked always

603
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,730
existed for her to create that a

604
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,980
little bit more advanced

605
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,010
regular expression to do that matching and

606
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:34,840
so i had to do a regular

607
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,560
expression

608
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,670
and with not matches to make it

609
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,340
work so that would be

610
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,420
where do we have it

611
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,390
not much just regular expression

612
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,960
so it can't face cm or false

613
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,530
basically

614
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,590
may trigger

615
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,540
i could actually write it the equal

616
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,390
see him too as well so creating

617
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,020
this tag

618
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,270
should be what we need and if

619
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,280
i do this i publish it

620
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,860
the if we go back to the

621
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:21,460
site

622
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,530
delete this and reload

623
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,190
the remembered as well

624
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,010
okay so now i'm looking and it

625
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,360
seems like we're not having their matomo

626
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,270
cookies set and we can see that

627
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,850
see him false and if i click

628
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,830
accept on this one we'd see that

629
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,290
the value changes to see him true

630
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,430
if i reload

631
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,740
now we can also see that we

632
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,780
get the limit on the cookie consent

633
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,670
so that's how it works basically

634
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,520
let's see if we have more questions

635
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,970
so while another question is if it

636
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,641
is possible with this setup to separate

637
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,110
or look into users who didn't give

638
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,560
consent

639
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,020
or

640
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,520
well no not really nah you can

641
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,160
only a fee

642
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,910
you says that are new but that

643
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,890
if not necessarily the same thing as

644
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,710
keeping your consent and what you could

645
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,140
do is prohibitive to the store create

646
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,580
the dimensioning matomo

647
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,050
and the store the consent given by

648
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,320
you

649
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,770
and do it that way

650
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,540
cave thank you

651
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,210
another question or sup it has been

652
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,940
discussed in the ted is if there's

653
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,470
a way not to write a personal

654
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:10,510
name for a published burst version of

655
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,050
the text

656
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,180
yeah

657
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,400
so i think i might i showed

658
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,410
you so when i do i'm gonna

659
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:23,320
publish something new if you add a

660
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,060
number here too much more it will

661
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,230
actually start counting up automatically though if

662
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,810
i publish now i always thought by

663
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,510
just writing one now so ever

664
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,430
the time i create a new version

665
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,370
of promise publish a new release it

666
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,760
will actually be an added automatically so

667
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,040
now i created a new version properly

668
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,570
if you see it in the version

669
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,790
number it's number three and if i

670
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,400
click create new version it will automatically

671
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,890
be four so that's actually a pretty

672
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,490
nice one

673
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,917
and then you don't have to write

674
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:56,770
in the descriptions

675
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,720
thank you

676
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,510
another one if i go back to

677
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,760
the earlier published version above the tags

678
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,100
triggers and variables back to the earlier

679
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,580
versions

680
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,800
yeah so you can actually have a

681
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,470
if you go to diversion history you

682
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,440
can actually see which version that is

683
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,930
published live than i should probably read

684
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,300
this one oh yeah now i'm looking

685
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,660
at different segment or accounts i think

686
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,480
this is a bit but yeah so

687
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,010
here you have marked more for version

688
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:35,170
so basically you can go down here

689
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,630
and just kick on this little icon

690
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,020
and publish the old version like this

691
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,690
so now this version will be running

692
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,590
in your light production so that that's

693
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,600
pretty easy there what i would like

694
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,371
to see is a better way to

695
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,480
do a diff between versions to do

696
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,280
that right now at least as far

697
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,870
as i know you basically have to

698
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,920
export the configuration so that's also nice

699
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,120
thing you can click on this little

700
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,570
icon

701
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,060
and that will actually give you a

702
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,659
jason file containing the current version but

703
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,739
it would be nice to have an

704
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,409
interface that really telling us what's happening

705
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,699
alright anything else

706
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,230
cape another thing that has been discussed

707
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,389
in the in the thread before the

708
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,880
notice that the answer is curse is

709
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,550
enough yet it would be worth regulation

710
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,590
in sweden regarding the use of adobo

711
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,639
and there is no regulation in sweden

712
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,159
in terms of of matomo there is

713
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,679
t de pr and there is some

714
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,860
other laws are in regards to privacy

715
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,100
so right now it's a lot of

716
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,190
discussions on how to interpret them

717
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:55,030
i thought what was the judgment to

718
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,610
do as i think that most of

719
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,510
the european union is discussing there are

720
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,780
no reading lamp statements about matomo but

721
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,880
what we see is that basically the

722
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,580
whole public sector in sweden if leaving

723
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,010
google analytics and most of them are

724
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,430
moving

725
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,210
two matomo

726
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,060
the discussion i had with a lot

727
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,950
of them right now is whether the

728
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,540
solution i showed you today

729
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:24,880
is legally ok or not to to

730
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,254
actually track users without the consent

731
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,260
or not

732
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,980
and that refers more to the cookie

733
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,210
law than gdp are

734
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,970
thank you for that and i think

735
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,680
that's all the questions that have been

736
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,480
asked until now i'm going to wait

737
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,890
a few more seconds just to see

738
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,260
if if another one comes up but

739
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,690
it would seem that is not the

740
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,470
case and so once again thank you

741
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,100
for a thought

742
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,770
if the any item requested the ted

743
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,510
stays openness as with yellow ducks

744
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,690
i will be available for ten more

745
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,180
minutes to answer questions or have a

746
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,700
dialogue in the chat is on then

747
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:17,350
ticket and have a good edit youtube
