if we do have enough time we'll

65
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,220
also be opening up the floor to

66
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,630
any questions at that time that you

67
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,690
may have just randomly so let's get

68
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,550
started number one we've got some ewi

69
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,590
tips so the first tip of gut

70
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,200
fee today is called zenmate

71
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,790
note so for those of you who

72
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,160
have never used zen mode before what

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,810
it basically does is it provides you

74
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,900
with an uninterrupted view of your mature

75
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,540
reports or your mattel dashboard and it

76
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,880
can be really really useful for situations

77
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,070
where you want to have a dashboard

78
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,160
on a dedicated screen or a dedicated

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,360
vice if forced

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,160
showing reports for example she might have

81
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,140
a dedicated screen in your office for

82
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,880
looking at dashboards are pretty numbers and

83
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,100
charts that is the perfect thing to

84
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,320
use for this it can also be

85
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,450
quite useful if you wanted to embed

86
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,640
for example the entire matua you i

87
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,020
into an i frame so toggling zen

88
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,520
mode on and off can then add

89
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,580
allow you to quite easily navigate between

90
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,290
the different reports within the i frame

91
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,910
and then when you want to bring

92
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,890
that into so full screen mode you

93
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,330
can quickly toggle the zen mode and

94
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,720
you have that awesome uninterrupted view of

95
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,690
your dashboard or for your reports so

96
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,580
if you've never seen what zemo looks

97
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,680
like before and i'll go

98
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
to show a screen which hopefully a

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,650
lot of you are familiar with this

100
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,260
is what the standard you i in

101
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,300
matomo looks like i'm pretty sure this

102
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,140
is something that a lot of you

103
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,420
see probably on a daily basis maybe

104
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,180
less often for other people but what

105
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,940
zen mode basically does is this it

106
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,380
gets rid of the the top menu

107
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,608
bar gets rid of the menus on

108
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,450
the left hand side

109
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,140
and in the screenshot here i've kind

110
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,050
of added the screenshot including the ural

111
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,605
bar at the top but if he

112
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,590
did once have this nice big screen

113
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,030
you can go to full screen and

114
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,190
you can have that really awesome uninterrupted

115
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,469
view of your mature reports

116
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,320
see if you've never used it before

117
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,120
there's actually two different ways we can

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
get to zen mode how he can

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
toggle it on and off said the

120
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,580
one option of course is to just

121
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,550
click on a small little toggle button

122
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,690
at the top of the page over

123
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,060
here the other option which is my

124
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,500
preferred option is just to hit the

125
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,360
z key on your keyboard that allows

126
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800
you to quickly switch between

127
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,570
when zen mode on and off

128
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,450
i to my next tip for you

129
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:47,598
today is the search function shortcut so

130
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:50,210
the first search function shortcut helps you

131
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,640
can quickly navigate within the midsummer you

132
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,540
i using your keyboard and keyboard arrows

133
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,160
so what it does is it allows

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,770
you to search for and switch between

135
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,840
websites and segments quite quickly

136
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,820
ie without having to touch your mouse

137
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,370
it also doubles as a search tool

138
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,590
to look for more information on the

139
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,960
matua dot org site for example you

140
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,940
can quickly search up for user guides

141
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,470
or maybe you have a question or

142
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,660
two that hopefully is answered in an

143
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,000
f a q so most of you

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,440
have probably seen the search bar up

145
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,000
in the top left hand side of

146
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,670
the matua ewi before but if you

147
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,250
wanted to quickly access this search feature

148
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:29,660
just hit the f key on your

149
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,110
keyboard

150
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,380
i the next you i tip for

151
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,660
today is themed so for those of

152
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,370
you who've who've kind of use matua

153
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,470
for a long time and have never

154
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,170
never really tried themes before it's really

155
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,000
something that you can use to kind

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,038
of customize the look the feel and

157
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,270
layout of the midsummer you i there

158
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,320
are actually several

159
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,500
all different themes available pretty much for

160
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,840
every midsummer you user in the world

161
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,630
that you can quickly install and activate

162
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,550
on your moto mo to get a

163
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,920
really customer that can field so some

164
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,030
of the default ones you can see

165
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,770
up in the screen now for example

166
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,540
we've got modern we've got the minimalist

167
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,150
themes we've got the dark themes but

168
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,480
then we have

169
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,830
have some of the themes that are

170
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,310
specific gst customizing fonts some that give

171
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,770
you really cool visualizations of us and

172
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,120
spock lines things like that

173
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,930
the really great thing about themes though

174
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,480
is that you're really not just limited

175
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,060
to these few themes that are available

176
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,890
themes are completely customizable you can customize

177
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,070
them to your heart's content and it

178
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,020
really requires very little skill if you

179
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,420
have a basic understanding of css

180
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,740
or maybe a little bit of less

181
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,170
you can customize as much as you

182
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,420
want and then upload those themes directly

183
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,150
to your midterm are you i say

184
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,610
if you've never installed or activated themes

185
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,590
before you probably wondering how do i

186
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,080
download and install themes now we see

187
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,130
we can have a look on the

188
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,860
website directly at themes dot moto mo

189
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:01,550
dot org

190
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,130
but you can also directly have a

191
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,630
look at the themes from within your

192
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,060
matua you are so to do that

193
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,340
we just go to the administration icon

194
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,339
we go to platform and marketplace and

195
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,540
we click on the drop down menu

196
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,120
and we select themes from here you

197
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,470
can select any of the themes that

198
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,780
are available to download but you'll also

199
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,731
have a nice little button

200
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,480
but the top of the screen that

201
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,660
lets you upload your custom themes in

202
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,490
a zip file format that you can

203
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,100
then install and activate on your midterm

204
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,760
or instance

205
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,010
alright the next section is performance tips

206
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,030
so one of the biggest performance improvements

207
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,890
that you can make to your maternal

208
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,000
instance is to disable browser archiving and

209
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
then set up a crontab for archiving

210
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,000
you might be wondering why do we

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,240
we recommend disabling browser archiving now for

212
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,280
the majority of users out there that

213
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,010
have very small websites or websites that

214
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,510
might have only a few hundred visits

215
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,640
a day it's definitely not worth the

216
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,310
effort going ahead and setting up those

217
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,120
cron tabs and disabling browser archiving but

218
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,290
for those of you that are tracking

219
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,160
a little bit more

220
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,990
or you know maybe a few thousand

221
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,850
hits a day or maybe tens of

222
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,770
thousands of hits a day this is

223
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,684
probably one of the biggest improvements ie

224
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:23,000
you can make to the performance of

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,100
moto mo that you can see very

226
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,940
quick and tangible results so when we

227
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,079
have browser archiving enabled almost every time

228
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:33,314
a

229
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:35,839
user views a report matua needs to

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,140
process the the report that they're trying

231
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,489
to request their needs it needs to

232
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,679
go fetch all that raw data nisi

233
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,939
crunched the numbers and he should put

234
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,099
everything into pretty charts and numbers and

235
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:49,339
lines and presented onto the screen and

236
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,739
it does this on the fly or

237
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,180
basically in real time

238
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,160
so you can imagine if you're loading

239
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,780
a report that has a load of

240
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,689
data or reports that cover a long

241
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,630
period of time this can sometimes really

242
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,660
slow down and your experience in potomac

243
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,550
can sometimes could take quite a long

244
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,930
time for those reports to load

245
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,770
this sort of effect can really be

246
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,069
compounded when users are not aware of

247
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,140
this and it you know they might

248
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,540
be going around jumping through a bunch

249
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,069
of different reports wondering why the heck

250
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,170
is this thing taking so long what

251
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,270
i mean thereby compounding is if a

252
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,160
user clicks a one report it takes

253
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,689
three or four seconds to load and

254
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,199
they don't see

255
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,670
anything on the screen they decide hey

256
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,390
i'm going to have a look at

257
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,670
this report that report does the same

258
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,319
they can go through five or six

259
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,000
or seven different reports in a matter

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,130
of seconds and every single one of

261
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,229
those reports once you start loading them

262
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,079
in the user interface those requests have

263
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,699
already been sent them to my server

264
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,140
is working on them in the background

265
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:50,359
to try and process all that data

266
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:52,910
now the good thing is is when

267
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,589
they go back to those other reports

268
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,599
that they've already requested the data for

269
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,420
it should load relatively quickly the problem

270
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,530
is if they come back and do

271
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,209
that again in one or two hours

272
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,339
later it's going to need to do

273
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,369
that whole process over again so by

274
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:10,489
pre processing all of those reports using

275
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:12,854
we call a crontab for the core

276
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:16,395
archive command and setting up a schedule

277
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,724
and disabling that browser archiving we can

278
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:21,555
be one hundred per cent certain that

279
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,685
all of those reports can load really

280
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:26,204
really quickly and your matua users can

281
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:29,295
have a great experience so this setting

282
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,094
can actually be changed directly

283
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:33,104
within the general settings of your maternal

284
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:36,045
instance but it can also be set

285
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:39,015
up by setting the specific config setting

286
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,594
in your config that any to ph

287
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:43,125
pi but of course if you're not

288
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,375
familiar with messing around with the files

289
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,074
directly on the potomac server disabling this

290
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,864
within the u i is just perfect

291
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:54,314
alright it is still important however to

292
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:56,175
understand that there are going to be

293
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:59,594
some cases where mahama will still need

294
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,864
to to kind of process reports when

295
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:05,145
they're requested from the browser this is

296
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:08,324
specifically important when you're requesting for example

297
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,694
a date range report because a date

298
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:11,415
range report

299
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:14,295
cannot be pre processed and the other

300
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:15,944
thing as well if you have users

301
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:18,194
who have created segments in those segments

302
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:22,155
have been configured to be processed from

303
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:24,255
in real time or on the fly

304
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:26,984
those segments will also be triggering some

305
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:31,545
browser archiving requests alright the next

306
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:33,555
that we got for you has to

307
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:35,505
do with segments so what we talk

308
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,125
about with segments where it comes to

309
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,064
performance is we're talking about how far

310
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:44,175
back segments are processed by default on

311
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,515
your meter the server so when you

312
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,045
have a segment in the terminal you're

313
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,385
creating a segment or editing a segment

314
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:51,689
the default

315
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:53,655
the tumor is going to process that

316
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:56,204
root segment for is what we call

317
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:59,025
the beginning of time and that basically

318
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,765
means that the tumor is going to

319
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:03,645
process that segment from the very first

320
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,734
day that you have raw data now

321
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:09,464
for a lot of people this can

322
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,895
mean that you know there have

323
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,935
owing to process segment data going back

324
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,584
two or three or even more years

325
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,234
five or six years into the past

326
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,084
and so this can have a really

327
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:22,935
big impact on performance especially for those

328
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:25,094
people who have a lot of historical

329
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,444
or a lot of raw data

330
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:28,005
so

331
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,755
by changing this to a different times

332
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,555
frame for example you can change it

333
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:36,015
to automatically process on a back thirty

334
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:37,515
days or you can do it for

335
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:40,035
sixty days or three months or six

336
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:41,864
months or even a year you can

337
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:44,714
really customize and prevent your thomas server

338
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:47,324
from working too much and reports that

339
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,035
you might not need to use

340
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:53,655
so to change this setting we basically

341
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:55,484
need to add the following to our

342
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,094
config file now if you're wondering how

343
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,145
the heck are you going to remember

344
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,334
this all of this information is available

345
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:02,324
you can have a look in your

346
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,885
config file you can have a search

347
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:05,984
for it on the tumor a website

348
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,604
you can hopefully find some more information

349
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:09,494
about how to set this config file

350
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:11,954
well otherwise if you wanted to look

351
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,484
for this specific one you could maybe

352
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:14,834
take a screenshot have a look at

353
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,935
this recording afterwards and then you can

354
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:19,125
implement this into your config file settings

355
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,925
and of course like you can see

356
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,025
in the slide it's on the screen

357
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,125
there's a few different ways we can

358
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,805
set this up for example the one

359
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,905
at the top is the segment creation

360
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:29,655
time so

361
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,895
basically that means that no historical data

362
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,755
for that segment is going to be

363
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:37,484
processed from before the date was created

364
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:39,285
so for a lot of people that

365
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,875
are tracking may be tens of thousands

366
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,094
or even millions of hits every single

367
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:45,525
month this might be the most beneficial

368
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,685
one you can also have a smaller

369
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,814
time frame for the example

370
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,104
the one at the bottom is the

371
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:53,744
last ninety three so that's roughly about

372
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,305
three months historical data

373
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:58,214
so now that i've told you how

374
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:01,425
to disable browser archiving and that to

375
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,155
change how far back potomac goes back

376
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:06,854
to process all of the segment data

377
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,545
you're probably wondering how do i get

378
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:13,785
historical data when i've configured this setting

379
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:16,334
in the tema and that brings us

380
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:16,694
really nice

381
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:18,435
nicely into our next segment and that

382
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:21,525
is useful see ally commands now cla

383
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:24,104
is a acronym for a command line

384
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,655
interface and that might sound really scary

385
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:28,814
obama tomo when you install it onto

386
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:31,425
your server has a really cool what

387
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,255
we call the console script and the

388
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,045
console script allows you to run some

389
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:36,854
really specific

390
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:40,005
quick commands directly on your thomas server

391
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:41,954
that allow you to do things or

392
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:43,545
accomplish tasks that you want to do

393
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:45,915
so we've got a couple of different

394
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,535
seal ai commands that we're going to

395
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,454
talk about today we're going to talk

396
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,944
about how to invalidate specific date ranges

397
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:55,155
so this is very useful for archiving

398
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,015
specific segments further back

399
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:59,444
then what we've just recently changed in

400
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:02,055
our settings we're also going to have

401
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:05,625
a look at invalidating specific segments and

402
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,064
then number three which is something that

403
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,444
you might not have been aware of

404
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:13,185
his invalidating specific plugins so if you

405
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:15,494
don't know matua four actually ships with

406
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:17,161
a new feature that

407
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:19,635
allows plugins that support that new feature

408
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:23,834
to automatically archive reports going back a

409
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,454
certain number of months or for example

410
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:27,584
if you've just installed a brand new

411
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,385
plugin or you've just purchased a premium

412
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:31,094
plugin and you go ahead and install

413
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,824
that onto your midterm a server the

414
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:35,175
great thing is that moto mo is

415
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,334
going to go back and on

416
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:40,484
automatically archive the last six months of

417
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:43,305
data for that new plugin so that

418
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:46,125
means that you have instant access to

419
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:49,814
a great wealth of historical report data

420
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,045
for that new plugin

421
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,525
however sometimes it's still going to be

422
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:58,125
necessary to archive reports going further back

423
00:15:58,395 --> 00:15:59,747
than what we've just set up in

424
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:02,354
our settings this is especially useful when

425
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:03,584
you just install the plugin you want

426
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,204
to have a look at we know

427
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,484
what was the data for this plugin

428
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,255
a year ago or two years ago

429
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:10,994
or even further back than that as

430
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,375
far back as what you have

431
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,334
of raw data

432
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:18,165
so that is when the core invalidate

433
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,834
report data console command it comes in

434
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:22,334
so as you can see an example

435
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,614
on the screen in this example we're

436
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:28,214
running the invalidate report data console command

437
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:31,454
so this command always requires a dates

438
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:33,675
option as you can see in the

439
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,484
example

440
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:36,675
we have guts for example from the

441
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,925
first of june up until today so

442
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:41,385
that will basically invalidate all repeat were

443
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:44,505
all report data for your entire matua

444
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,454
instance going from the first of june

445
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:49,305
till today you can also use other

446
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,824
types of date format such as the

447
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,645
last thirty or last seven or last

448
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:54,854
night

449
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:56,385
ninety you know things like that to

450
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:58,035
kind of just get a general date

451
00:16:58,035 --> 00:16:59,145
range invalidated

452
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:02,354
and so some of you if you're

453
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,605
having a look at this might be

454
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:06,855
remembering that we do have what we

455
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:10,484
call the invalidate reports plugin that also

456
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,865
allows you as you can see in

457
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,675
this example to invalidate segments the biggest

458
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:18,194
difference of course between the plugin and

459
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:19,994
the console command is that the plugin

460
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:20,534
is

461
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,784
kind of like what we would consider

462
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:25,724
a sledgehammer when you're trying to invalidate

463
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:29,625
report data it it doesn't necessarily differentiate

464
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,774
between different specific dates or specific plugins

465
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,485
it's kind of an all or nothing

466
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:37,065
deal and that's where it really comes

467
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,554
in handy knowing how to work with

468
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:40,695
the cla command

469
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,435
ns and you can combine a lot

470
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,804
of these different options together to get

471
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:48,075
some really specific date ranges or specific

472
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,804
report data that you're looking for so

473
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,605
as you can see in the example

474
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,155
over here we've just put the plain

475
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:58,995
text name of our segment and in

476
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,735
the next one you'll see that we

477
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:00,855
can

478
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:04,845
now also invalidate some very specific plugins

479
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:07,095
so this is really where the seal

480
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:09,975
ai commands are a lot more useful

481
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:13,725
than just invalidating report data in the

482
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,245
us so when we combine all of

483
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:18,465
these together we get the ability to

484
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,925
not only invalidate reports for a specific

485
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:21,014
day

486
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:23,715
date range and for a specific segment

487
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,715
but also for a very specific plugin

488
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:31,973
so this is really really useful and

489
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:33,885
that once you've done all this of

490
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:36,315
course it then becomes necessary to re

491
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,534
process that data and that brings us

492
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,945
to the very last step in this

493
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:43,635
specific section and that is reprocessing the

494
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:46,754
report data that we've just invalidated using

495
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:47,895
the force

496
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:51,225
date range option so in this example

497
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,115
we're looking at the last one that

498
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,965
we use the core invalidate report data

499
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:57,855
where we set the dates as the

500
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,745
first of june to the last of

501
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,815
june and when we run this last

502
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:04,754
core archive command with the force date

503
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:07,935
range similar to or exactly matching where

504
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:08,043
we

505
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:11,205
just invalidated metamora is going to only

506
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:14,085
go ahead and process that specific date

507
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:16,754
range for that specific plugin

508
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:21,705
so some plugins do actually have their

509
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:25,095
own console commands that can be used

510
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,685
for archiving which we'll talk about in

511
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,754
a minute but what a load of

512
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:30,105
you may be wondering is like ooh

513
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,425
do i have to take a screenshot

514
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:32,804
of this page do i have to

515
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:35,145
memorize all of this information that's in

516
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:36,225
front of me right now so that

517
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,695
i know how to use it and

518
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:38,024
the great

519
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:40,304
news is no you don't have to

520
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,245
memorize or take a screenshot of any

521
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,955
of this data because all of this

522
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,565
is directly available when you run the

523
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:50,355
console commands directly on your potomac server

524
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:52,695
and we can find this information by

525
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:55,965
using the dash dash help option that

526
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:57,524
the dash dash help option

527
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:00,524
when you're working the cla commands is

528
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,985
your absolute best friend if you've ever

529
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,534
forgotten what the specific command is or

530
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:07,995
what type of input you need to

531
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:10,274
give for a specific option the dash

532
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:11,804
dash help option is going to show

533
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:14,145
that so here for example in this

534
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,534
slide we've got with the help output

535
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:18,375
for the core

536
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,702
archive command so as you can see

537
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,800
in the screen hopefully the text isn't

538
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,480
too small we can see all of

539
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,940
the potential options that we could add

540
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,370
to this kind of really narrow down

541
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,159
and get some very specific commands that

542
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,020
we can use for our server

543
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,870
so as i mentioned earlier we do

544
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,520
have some plugins that might have some

545
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,490
very specific commands a good example of

546
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,340
a plugin that has it's own archiving

547
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,429
command is the customer reports plugin so

548
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:49,889
where the customer ports a console command

549
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,080
it allows you to actually go in

550
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,290
and specifically just archive the customer

551
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,870
ports for a specific date range without

552
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,510
needing to first invalidate that data

553
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,909
now a lot of you might be

554
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,530
wondering you know do i need to

555
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,520
have a look at that do i

556
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,629
need to go look at a guide

557
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:09,120
for that sort of information and here's

558
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,740
the next really great tip is that

559
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,570
no you really don't have to know

560
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,570
that information beforehand the console command if

561
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,300
you just type in console on an

562
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,179
ssh or in a terminal window in

563
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:21,690
the midterm

564
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,149
root directory and you add the dash

565
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,550
dash list option it's going to give

566
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,649
you a full list of all of

567
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,810
the console commands that you can run

568
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,990
directly on your matua server and now

569
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,460
that you've got this great list of

570
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,980
console commands you can then run those

571
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,560
specific commands each with their own dash

572
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,850
dash help or dash

573
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,919
ash help option to get a list

574
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,985
of all the optional parameters or required

575
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:49,409
parameters that that specific plugin requires

576
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,360
so

577
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,379
the important thing to remember whenever you're

578
00:21:55,383 --> 00:21:57,120
working on this thing is that just

579
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,250
because a command works on one meter

580
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,800
amr server doesn't necessarily mean that it

581
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,260
works on every other tomato server and

582
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,149
the reason for this is that every

583
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,669
plugin that you install has the ability

584
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,250
to add options to that list so

585
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,389
in other words wait

586
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:14,790
we're talking about all of these console

587
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,980
commands can be or are in a

588
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,379
lot of cases server specific sir if

589
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,899
you're ever curious about how to run

590
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:24,149
these console commands how do i figure

591
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:25,139
out how to use all of this

592
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,540
stuff use the list command use the

593
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,879
help command and build your command from

594
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:30,120
there

595
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,350
alright so our next section is going

596
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,110
to be useful free plugins and these

597
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,750
are specifically plugins that are not installed

598
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,960
in moto mo by default but are

599
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,320
available to be downloaded and installed directly

600
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
from within your maternal instance without requiring

601
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,450
any additional information all you basic

602
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,669
we have to do is click download

603
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:57,057
and install from your meter maintenance and

604
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,800
we're going to start with the first

605
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,380
one on my list at least and

606
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,940
in my opinion one of the best

607
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,389
free plugins that you can install called

608
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:07,800
the cute tracking plugin

609
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,090
so the queue tracking plugin it improves

610
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,790
the performance and the stability of your

611
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,700
motto my server by reducing the load

612
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,970
on the potomac database during tracking it

613
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,760
also at the same time really greatly

614
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,120
improves the speed of tracking requests sent

615
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,500
to your maternal server

616
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,840
so how this works does take a

617
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,419
little bit of an explanation so we're

618
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:35,520
going to do that now so hopefully

619
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,110
you'll see a graphic on your screen

620
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,730
and what we're looking at here is

621
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,310
what we would consider a normal tracking

622
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,553
requests so you can see it with

623
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:44,669
the top there the browser sends that

624
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,300
http tracking request that tracking request then

625
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,290
gets received by the

626
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,020
toma server and needs to be processed

627
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:55,080
it's then inserted directly into the potomac

628
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,649
database into that role visit slug and

629
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,360
then once it's inserted we send that

630
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,889
response to the browser

631
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
now the queue tracking plugin this behavior

632
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,200
changes in a few key ways says

633
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,490
you can see in the next graphic

634
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,159
as soon as the moto mod server

635
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,480
so here at the top again we

636
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,629
can see the http tracking request as

637
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,730
soon as that is received by the

638
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,620
server it's put into a queue

639
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,320
and then immediately the matua server responds

640
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,687
to that browser or to that device

641
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,760
or that application to say great i've

642
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,560
got that tracking request you can carry

643
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,320
on once that tracking request is then

644
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,270
placed into the queue there's a few

645
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,820
different things that can happen now number

646
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,260
one you can either set up your

647
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,290
moto instance to automatically process

648
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,820
is all of the requests that are

649
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,310
in the queue when the queue reaches

650
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,770
a certain threshold but it can also

651
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,270
be set up to be run on

652
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,100
a schedule so for example you can

653
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,169
process all of the requests in the

654
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,149
queue once every minute or once every

655
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:00,149
two or three minutes and what this

656
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,409
really does is that

657
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,080
like you saw in the beginning it

658
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,810
not only improves the tracker performance but

659
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,090
it also enables your mid toma server

660
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,169
to handle very large traffic peaks without

661
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,030
bringing down your database server and the

662
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,350
way that it does this is that

663
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,960
instead of sending you know small little

664
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,350
individual single tracking requests every single time

665
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:22,649
one

666
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,020
this tracking request is received to the

667
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,750
database server it can process all of

668
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,090
the tracking requests in that queue as

669
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,730
a batch tracking requests so it really

670
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,370
helps your matua server and it really

671
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,169
makes it a lot more stable and

672
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,290
capable of handling those very large tracking

673
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:40,830
peaks

674
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,800
i the next one on the list

675
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,190
is the tracking spam prevention plugin so

676
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,710
the tracking spam prevention plugin gives you

677
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,020
some really good options that you can

678
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,649
enable to prevent spam tracking requests being

679
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:58,379
sent or logged in your matua server

680
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,780
so it does this by giving you

681
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,010
a couple of options for

682
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,200
first option gives you is blocking requests

683
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,470
from cloud providers so this is really

684
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,480
useful for example if you have a

685
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,790
malicious or a bad actor that's sending

686
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,770
you a lot of tracking requests from

687
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,050
a server somewhere specifically in the world

688
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,510
and the problem might be that they're

689
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,950
using a lot of different servers you

690
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,020
can't block all of those ip ranges

691
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,850
will the great news is the spec

692
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:27,450
tracking spam prevention plugin is going to

693
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,590
really help you in that

694
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:31,950
number two is that it can automatically

695
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,159
block requests from headless browsers headless browsers

696
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,470
are notorious for people that tried to

697
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,080
send these sorts of requests because the

698
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,550
load that it puts in the device

699
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,710
sending those requests is a lot lower

700
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,270
than a fully fledged browser

701
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,290
number three it can restrict the number

702
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,110
of actions in a single visit or

703
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,389
the maximum number of actions that matua

704
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:57,419
will track in a single visit this

705
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,450
is especially useful to prevent spam visits

706
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,030
that might spoil that can sometimes track

707
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,760
hundreds or even thousands of actions in

708
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,510
a single visit

709
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,179
we've seen some examples with people that

710
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,980
we've provided support to in the past

711
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,690
from the potomac team where they have

712
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,830
had individual visits tracked over ten thousand

713
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,169
actions in a single visit in a

714
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,570
matter of minutes or even hours and

715
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,100
the great way is that you can

716
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,730
automatically block this or cap the number

717
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,889
for tracking requests that can be tracked

718
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,460
in a single instance and number for

719
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,389
it kings exclude specific countries or it

720
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,810
can allow you to only include specific

721
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,899
countries so this is really useful for

722
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,550
example if you have a website that

723
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,889
is specifically targeting or spin

724
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,409
civically only working in a single country

725
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:51,780
or in a single group of countries

726
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,750
to automatically exclude any tracking requests from

727
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,909
countries outside of that but it can

728
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,620
also be useful to very quickly and

729
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,830
easily exclude specific countries if you notice

730
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,330
that you're getting a lot of spam

731
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,629
or non legitimate tracking requests from those

732
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:07,050
countries

733
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:07,200
nice

734
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,649
alright the next plugin on the list

735
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,629
which is an absolute must have is

736
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:17,190
the marketing campaigns reporting so by default

737
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,679
matomo will give you the option or

738
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,050
we'll give you the ability to track

739
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,790
campaigns and it comes with a really

740
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,300
useful campaign your l builder directly in

741
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,169
the matter where you are

742
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,659
however a lot of people or let

743
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,330
me rather say most people probably already

744
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,450
have campaigns set up that they're using

745
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,909
to drive traffic to their site using

746
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,010
campaign needs that are oftentimes set up

747
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,139
in their ad networks or with specific

748
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,500
social networks and the marketing campaigns reporting

749
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,570
plugin extends that do

750
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,200
default capability that default campaigns reporting to

751
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,210
give you access to all of the

752
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,950
possible campaign parameters used by these platforms

753
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,379
as well as providing support for some

754
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:05,010
of these campaign tracking parameters without needing

755
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,720
to use any of the mid to

756
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,730
most specific campaign

757
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,950
parameters we have a really great blog

758
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,409
post available on our blog that you

759
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:14,580
can go and read up about the

760
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,190
marketing campaigns reporting and i would definitely

761
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,379
recommend installing it on your meter missouri

762
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,379
alright that extra one on the list

763
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:23,909
is probably a little bit more for

764
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,940
the moto mo administrators out there sir

765
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:28,830
that's called the log viewer so the

766
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,810
log viewer is kind of more just

767
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,909
a quality of life or convenience plugin

768
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,950
that you can install to have a

769
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,679
quick look at the moto mo application

770
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,570
logs so this can really save you

771
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,649
some time and effort

772
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,230
i instead of having to ssh into

773
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,629
your server and grip some logs or

774
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:47,850
download your logs from your syslog server

775
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,040
you just log into me tomo go

776
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,620
to administration you i and have a

777
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,060
look at the logs directly

778
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,810
alright and the next one on our

779
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,440
list is the custom alerts plugin so

780
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,629
the customer alerts plug in is really

781
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:05,310
great especially if you're not somebody who's

782
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,440
looking at the reports every single day

783
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,010
or the customer alerts plugin law allows

784
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,679
you to do is to get notified

785
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,450
when something change

786
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,659
changes or something happens something specific happens

787
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,760
in your midterm or instance or on

788
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,550
the websites that you're tracking for example

789
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,230
you can set up an alert when

790
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,360
your website gets more than three hundred

791
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,730
views in a day you can have

792
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,620
another alert set up for example if

793
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,629
a specific product sells less than one

794
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:35,610
hundred items in a specific

795
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,760
but alerts can be set up in

796
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,250
other ways as well for example you

797
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,860
can set up alerts as percentages so

798
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,659
you can set up alert for example

799
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,510
that notifies you if the traffic to

800
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,690
your website drops by more than fifty

801
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,600
percent in a given timeframe and obviously

802
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,889
if a fifty percent drop

803
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,440
over a given time frame probably indicates

804
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,810
that something big has changed or something

805
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,669
has happened you can also set it

806
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:05,040
up for if you have zero visits

807
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,720
now we see sera visits would be

808
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:10,409
a pretty bad outcome for you you

809
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,510
want to be sure that you're getting

810
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,800
all of the tracking data and that

811
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,540
nothing is wrong with that tracking data

812
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:18,090
so for those types of alerts you

813
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,159
can actually set them up not only

814
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,530
as an email alert but also as

815
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,020
an sms alert so if you're setting

816
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,580
up an sms alert you'll need to

817
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,870
make sure that you also set up

818
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,690
the mobile messaging plugin now the mobile

819
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,570
messaging plugin is included in potomac core

820
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,149
but it might not be activated on

821
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,540
your motto

822
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,530
i'm a server so if you want

823
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,149
to set up sms alerts with a

824
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,310
custom alerts plugin you'll need to go

825
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,530
ahead and activate that plugin as well

826
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,440
and the last plugin on our list

827
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,080
for today is the ip to company

828
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,379
plugin this one kind of explains itself

829
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,570
and what it does is it adds

830
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,510
the functionality to your motto my server

831
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,750
to easily see if visits to your

832
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,389
website or app or connecting from any

833
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,860
known ip array

834
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,429
wages for specific companies so this is

835
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:11,340
really useful especially for if your website

836
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,040
or even your marketing campaigns are specifically

837
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,800
targeting a certain market segment or even

838
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,220
a very specific company it also provide

839
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,899
you some reports for these as well

840
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,460
as you can see which companies are

841
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,690
visiting your website

842
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,360
or using your application more than others

843
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,210
and at all of these plugins can

844
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,120
be found on the midterm or plugins

845
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,850
website at plug ins that mattel dot

846
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,980
org there is a massive list of

847
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,530
plugins that didn't make the cut unfortunately

848
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,840
for this session today see if you're

849
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,399
ever curious if you wanted to know

850
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,179
how you can ex

851
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,940
attend the capability of your matua server

852
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,169
have a look at the list of

853
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,310
plugins available there

854
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,480
and that alternatively you can also find

855
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,909
them in the marketplace section of your

856
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:59,790
matua server from there you can directly

857
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,429
install and activate and start using these

858
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:03,360
awesome plugins

859
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,810
alright and that brings us to the

860
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,820
end of the last segment for this

861
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:11,129
matter my camp session so we're going

862
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:12,659
to move on to some question and

863
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,270
answers now so if you haven't yet

864
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,460
had an opportunity to send some questions

865
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,830
through to the chat just gonna take

866
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,800
minutes the moderator has sent some questions

867
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,540
through to us on the show

868
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,679
that on the side as well so

869
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,360
we'll just have a quick look through

870
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,710
those questions and see if we can

871
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,460
answer some of them

872
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,379
how is it liked to work for

873
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,899
the miss tomoe or inner craft team

874
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,780
this is a question from ronan and

875
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,760
honestly it's been probably one of the

876
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,129
best work experiences that i've ever had

877
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,050
in my life the team is amazing

878
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,210
it's awesome to work in a group

879
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,550
of people that are us

880
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,000
conscious about open source mit software conscious

881
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,429
about being open and sharing and it's

882
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:58,620
it's really just a great company culture

883
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,070
overall what are the next big features

884
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,370
the team is working on and so

885
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,629
yeah there's not a lot of big

886
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,600
secrets when it comes to how you

887
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,860
know what sort of features

888
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,480
we're working on if you want to

889
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,520
know what features we're working on next

890
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:15,870
you can probably have a look at

891
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,210
the git hub issues page and you

892
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,340
can kind of see kind of looking

893
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,900
at those milestones and they get how

894
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,949
page you can kind of get a

895
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,750
feeling of what features are going to

896
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,219
be worked on next what is the

897
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,989
priority for those sorts of things

898
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,850
can we add new shortcuts with moto

899
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,620
mo this is actually something i'm not

900
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,759
one hundred per cent sure and i

901
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:38,159
don't think we have the option to

902
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,679
have keyboard shortcuts but that's definitely something

903
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,239
that i'll have a look at and

904
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,590
asked the team about as well

905
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,719
do we have any plans to develop

906
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,139
more documentation about how to make more

907
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,779
attractive teams so i'm not sure who

908
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:57,630
asked that question specifically but we do

909
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,690
actually have a developer's guide available on

910
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,110
our developer documentation on how to create

911
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,560
themes

912
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,038
obviously there are no there's not necessarily

913
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,670
very specific examples of what you can

914
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,250
do the main reason for that is

915
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,900
that it's it's kind of really open

916
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,520
if you know a little bit about

917
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,170
css you know a little bit about

918
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,660
less you can go happy and hack

919
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,029
away all day every day and create

920
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,020
really cool custom

921
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,210
my steams something that i may not

922
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,460
have mentioned earlier is that you're not

923
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,000
just limited to using css or less

924
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,570
you can also include javascript files in

925
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,570
your plugins to kind of extended even

926
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,540
further than what css or less would

927
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,290
allow you to do

928
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,620
alright linaro asks in the chatroom does

929
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,730
the spam prevention work retroactive to filter

930
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,090
out already made spam visits no so

931
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,850
that the the tracking spam prevention plugin

932
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,670
doesn't work retroactively said this is something

933
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,620
that you would need to install too

934
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,130
prevent future spam tracking requests if you

935
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,830
do have a very specific spam tracking

936
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,500
requests the best way to get rid

937
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:16,470
of that data those spam tracking requests

938
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,960
is to use the gdp are tools

939
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,380
available within moto mo and that can

940
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,240
be kind of useful especially if they've

941
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,730
for example all of the tracking requests

942
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,740
came from a certain ip address or

943
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,230
if they came from a certain country

944
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,590
or they track certain specific things to

945
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,210
your meter or instance you can use

946
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,759
those gdp are tools to very quickly

947
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:40,860
and easily delete all of that data

948
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,120
alright that's all the some of the

949
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,420
questions that we've got on the are

950
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,250
we having any plans to make the

951
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,200
config that he need a ph p

952
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,040
file accessible from the eu i know

953
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,779
i don't think we've got any plans

954
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,170
to make that config file editable from

955
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,220
within the eu i but

956
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,980
it is possible to view the config

957
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,440
file from the eu i do not

958
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,830
necessarily just limited to the config does

959
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,420
he need a ph be but there

960
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,090
is a section under the diagnostics tab

961
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,529
that you can actually go and have

962
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:18,180
a look at all of the settings

963
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,549
that are currently set either in the

964
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:22,020
global config file or the

965
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,660
config does he need a page p

966
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,360
within your matua instance the reason why

967
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,640
we wouldn't necessarily make it directly edit

968
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,370
editable from the u i is because

969
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,049
a lot of the settings that you

970
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:35,700
set in the config that you need

971
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:38,520
a ph pi can override some of

972
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,440
the settings that you might set in

973
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,540
your user inter

974
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:42,930
face

975
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,540
i just having a look for a

976
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:52,080
couple more questions do you have any

977
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,840
tips for solving upgrade issues sometimes the

978
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,210
upgrade fails and the database and core

979
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,700
are not the same version there have

980
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,440
been several questions on this in the

981
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,779
forum but there isn't a good solution

982
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,730
that's a really great question and it's

983
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,620
actually something that i helped one or

984
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,390
two customers within the last couple of

985
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,700
weeks as well it might be really

986
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,230
useful from our end just to put

987
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,549
that into an f a q it's

988
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:16,470
something that i've kind of been planning

989
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,660
to do as well but yes there

990
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,850
is actually a way that you can

991
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,130
roll back the version that is stored

992
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,299
in the database so

993
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,790
that matua can re rerun all of

994
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,450
those database upgrade commands so stay tuned

995
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,580
i dunno if you have it any

996
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,570
way that you can kind of keep

997
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,529
an eye on some of the f

998
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,860
a q's otherwise feel free to shoot

999
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,470
us an email at support admitted org

1000
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,830
just asking about that information about those

1001
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,460
specific step

1002
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,020
oops and if we don't yet have

1003
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,340
that effect you out there will be

1004
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,960
more than happy to send that information

1005
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,380
on to you

1006
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,759
could you give a general definition of

1007
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:57,029
what archiving means yet so archiving is

1008
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:01,230
basically the process that matua uses to

1009
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,890
kind of process all of that raw

1010
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,390
data so as you can imagine if

1011
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,060
you're sending hundreds of thousands of tracking

1012
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,620
requests or hits to your

1013
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,830
matua interface that data on it's own

1014
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,920
isn't really useful other than just to

1015
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,560
kind of look at in reality so

1016
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,690
what archiving does is it takes that

1017
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,810
raw data and it parses through every

1018
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,790
single piece of that raw data and

1019
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,920
that is used to then generate the

1020
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,330
reports that you view

1021
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,190
in your maternal instance

1022
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,120
alright anyone else got a couple more

1023
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,080
questions for us

1024
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,440
alright that looks like all the questions

1025
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,400
for today and so that means that

1026
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,620
we're actually almost out of time i

1027
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,970
really just wanted to say thank you

1028
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,830
everyone for joining thank you so much

1029
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,779
for the awesome questions that you that

1030
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,820
you asked i hope that everybody learned

1031
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,299
something new

1032
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:07,890
you today that will help give you

1033
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,380
success with me tomo and i'd also

1034
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,690
like to give a massive thank you

1035
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,390
to the volunteers that have made matua

1036
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,290
camp possible this really is a community

1037
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,790
driven event and none of this will

1038
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,520
be possible without the awesome contribution of

1039
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:26,040
the volunteers as well as the sponsors

1040
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,750
have a great day everyone buy anything
