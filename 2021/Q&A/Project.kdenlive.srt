different use cases from beginner friendly content

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,160
to acquire a topic for thoughtful

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
focusing quite on experts and i guess

7

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,340
yep the bitterness i hope everyone can

77
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,670
see the screen and let's just wait

78
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,880
to have a few minutes for questions

79
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,890
maybe in the same meantime while people

80
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,620
are typing questions mere sum of years

81
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,060
some one of you if any one

82
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,910
of you have answered

83
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,080
quick introduction or talk about some topic

84
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,190
or they can talk about it now

85
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,690
or maybe

86
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,370
a question to all how do you

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,310
learn something about matomo or what is

88
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,350
your entry point or what was your

89
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,160
entry point

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,180
or were there too you can ask

91
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,190
questions and beyond this matomo camp

92
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,300
heavy born maybe as first of all

93
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,780
and maybe not everyone knows that there

94
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,779
is a forum aboard and they can

95
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,140
ask questions where you can ask questions

96
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,620
in your mother tongue like germany and

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,740
there is syrup at a good support

98
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,520
in there

99
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,070
there and the other one is and

100
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,650
the the motto more support your cut

101
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,530
if you take the matomo cloud version

102
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,190
and maybe the other ones have also

103
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,090
some tips how to get more knowledge

104
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,230
about matomo

105
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,250
and a good point a bitter forgot

106
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,680
to introduce myself of course i am

107
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,960
lucas winkler and most of here of

108
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,150
course ma will know me from the

109
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,640
matomo for whom i spent more a

110
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,040
lot of my time answering people's question

111
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,890
on the matomo form but also maintaining

112
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,350
some other documentation and to

113
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,510
answering to get up issues and this

114
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,950
is also kind of the answer to

115
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,220
your question is sir if you have

116
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,830
any question about matomo if it's a

117
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,010
general question something doesn't work on your

118
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,080
your set up something like this the

119
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,360
best way probably the matomo for him

120
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,670
that a lot of people already have

121
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,600
asked that question

122
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,120
stand and it's a great way to

123
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,460
slowly get to the bottom of the

124
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,770
issue if you know that the finger

125
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,530
asking you to definitively a pack i

126
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,810
do have heard definitive steps how to

127
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,300
produce them you can skip the fallen

128
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,130
and go straight to get up and

129
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,830
a critic or her issue require air

130
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,640
back request

131
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,480
a back issue and there are that

132
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,780
way it ideally describing a lot of

133
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,508
details so people can reproduce it and

134
00:05:57,508 --> 00:06:01,200
this way if people can see it

135
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,750
it's a quickly organized under it's easier

136
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,440
to fix them

137
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,890
okay bye visit this introduction to have

138
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,320
been a lot of questions and i'll

139
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,250
start very fonda question from peter jones

140
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,165
and his asks there we can add

141
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:18,571
to use us in the matomo into

142
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:21,750
for a face or if wonder if

143
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,490
it will be possible to use groups

144
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,642
in the future this will be useful

145
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,600
there are hundreds of thousands of users

146
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,440
though

147
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,920
does anyone have to say something about

148
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,700
this maybe sir stephen i personally don't

149
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,790
know about this feature about this suggests

150
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,710
i don't i'm not even sure if

151
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,070
someone hassle even suggested it until now

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,853
but indeed the to my instances where

153
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,860
if a large amount of users and

154
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,890
some kind of grouping might be useful

155
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,256
especially to give fair access rights to

156
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,830
his site too many people at once

157
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,560
and there had been a couple of

158
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,860
requests m four and m more extends

159
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,630
and permission management and matomo am and

160
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,480
yeah some of them were i guess

161
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,970
asking for groups but there currently aren't

162
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,200
any plans

163
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,094
yep then again as a workaround until

164
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,200
ten or all of their use a

165
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,800
management feature say can be air also

166
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,020
accessed via the api i saw if

167
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,240
the issue is just having to manually

168
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,830
add to the hundreds of users to

169
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,560
add to the sites then of course

170
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,540
you can easily automate this with her

171
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,940
a script and the programming language of

172
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,610
your choice and to add to the

173
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,390
useless there

174
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:50,970
so

175
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,510
i hope this roughly answers the question

176
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,920
as a bit of their delay so

177
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,870
i will go on and if you

178
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,490
have any follow up to this or

179
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,480
simply ask again

180
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,490
so valentine asks which a killer feature

181
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,560
from google analytics do you think should

182
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
be included in matomo

183
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,860
secondary dimensions

184
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,900
and that there is sad that the

185
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,670
customer report is a very great plugin

186
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,490
for the moto macleod or you can

187
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,780
pay for the on-premise version but i

188
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,290
approve

189
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,720
maybe i missed something like secondary dimension

190
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,840
in time to to filter in time

191
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,890
not to make the customer report and

192
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,760
then maybe the the data takes a

193
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,990
little bit longer to process so i

194
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,320
wish

195
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,410
she i think i editor of a

196
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,130
feature request to to the second dimension

197
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,070
feature but on the technical side it's

198
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,550
a very huge feature and it's a

199
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,800
very i think it's very complicated to

200
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,900
integrate into matomo

201
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,250
i sing the data visualization parties as

202
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,220
well are missing somehow a highly asked

203
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,370
to buy into google and eight excusable

204
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,140
as google does to you or your

205
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,320
lover a conference tomorrow doubt of humbert

206
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,690
is that isn't that how to use

207
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,200
a mi

208
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,920
database with a matt white experts it's

209
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,260
still something which is kind of tacky

210
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,970
so you cannot put it within the

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,190
end of her marketers so a sink

212
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,070
of walking mohan the integration of meta

213
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,560
will wither the self pity that the

214
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,870
visualization system ought to have it's corner

215
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,360
more of a success that

216
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,700
that this realization system is of paramount

217
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,830
importance for her though metamora

218
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,050
one the feed feature that could be

219
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,230
included that valentin suggested that i and

220
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,520
now that i'll read it also find

221
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,790
a good idea is simply a life

222
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,330
view that shows the number of hits

223
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,280
in the last five minutes to get

224
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,040
the really close sir the hallmark

225
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,630
like i said seeing the website right

226
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,020
now a few which incidentally the now

227
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,490
that i am looking at the reports

228
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,710
for the matomo camp might also be

229
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,240
something interesting to see

230
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,240
in addition to i agree with thomas

231
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,159
as well definitely secondary dimensions then also

232
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,290
the decent way to to import and

233
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:43,594
adds additional data into the toolbar to

234
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,490
combine it with the dataset that you

235
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,920
already have in thing that would make

236
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,120
sense as well

237
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,240
okay i see an interesting not a

238
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,600
question from peter tones hey they have

239
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,790
an altar pv can stems for the

240
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,670
client to migrated to matomo by what

241
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,524
are your experiences of migrating period data

242
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,620
into my tomo may be something for

243
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,850
a pizza or stephen

244
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,040
and while i can take on this

245
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,700
one and it is it is possible

246
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,890
it depends on how much data do

247
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,800
you have in that instance so also

248
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
with low amounts of data and also

249
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
with high amounts of data it's definitely

250
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,220
possible but in case it can with

251
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,580
a higher

252
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,400
amount of data takes some time because

253
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,200
a lot of skin changes for the

254
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,800
my sql database are necessary and also

255
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,950
things can break because the version jump

256
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:48,292
from two or three to four is

257
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:51,790
is a major one and saw a

258
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,900
lot of things in the in the

259
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,680
database scheme

260
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,590
has have been optimized and have been

261
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,220
changed also so you should definitely make

262
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,800
sure to have a real good backup

263
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,320
before you start doing the that migration

264
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,370
and then think also about some some

265
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,190
outage of your matomo instance while you're

266
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,850
updating

267
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,280
at least with a with a bigger

268
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,600
amount of data you have in your

269
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,840
instance and a workaround could be for

270
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,590
example like you could just leave the

271
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,106
tracker running or writing into a locked

272
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:29,140
file and then after your migration is

273
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,840
complete you can import this lock file

274
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,060
with the replay law

275
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,670
the functionality of the locking porter so

276
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,410
you don't lose too much data

277
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,980
so the the replay logging are probably

278
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:45,640
the best solution for importing nearly this

279
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,290
data that would have come into the

280
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,220
instance while you had this outage but

281
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,850
all in all

282
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,300
you have to make sure that you

283
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,340
have a few hours of outage and

284
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,590
hematoma instance so your users have to

285
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,770
know and the stakeholders have to know

286
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,440
but all in all i also updated

287
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,740
i think twenty to thirty big instances

288
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,770
to matomo from pv or from the

289
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,760
early versions

290
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,520
and everything went perfectly well

291
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,690
one for a minor thing i also

292
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,820
want to add is something a lot

293
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,500
of fear even if it's a small

294
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,344
instant something a lot of people are

295
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,250
fighting there for if they have a

296
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,550
really alter period version is that this

297
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,950
really alter version of course also vans

298
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,450
with a really old version of e

299
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,400
h b and there might not even

300
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,700
be a

301
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,710
version of psp that is really old

302
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,020
people russia is compatible with and then

303
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,970
he was for tomoe vashon is compatible

304
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,220
with so that if it's a really

305
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,657
old version it might be useful to

306
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,170
appear few intermediate champs of a few

307
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,230
intermediate versions of matomo and maybe if

308
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,830
their compatibility requirements also required also

309
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,700
intermediate versions of dhb to make sure

310
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,920
the migration van face as smooth as

311
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,410
possible a lot of people might not

312
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,350
know it but on belts automotive on

313
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,960
the download page you can download air

314
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,600
to throw the motto every single matomo

315
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:15,850
version i figured has been released since

316
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,020
two thousand and eight

317
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,940
it's this way you can easily update

318
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,010
to another old version before you to

319
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,790
the next champ

320
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,320
so

321
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,660
another question form to let it sir

322
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,000
is there a possibility to to aggregate

323
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,670
that data directly in matomo saw the

324
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,860
number of users grouped by a certain

325
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,946
customer variable for instance she says i'm

326
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:47,050
mostly using the a p i and

327
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,510
then aggregate that data with python pandas

328
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,570
personally i can't see much helpful things

329
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,550
about it don't really have from much

330
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,640
experience with an use case where you

331
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,340
would have to aggregate data of costs

332
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,810
that way you are doing it for

333
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,820
your think they apply and then they're

334
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,060
doing any data processing afterwards of course

335
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,690
we're off

336
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,300
always works but might not be the

337
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,810
most idea one probably juliet will be

338
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,370
good to elaborate a bit on that

339
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,530
what you're trying to achieve because in

340
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,400
the custom dimension reports you have everything

341
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,090
grouped by the custom dimension in a

342
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,847
in in the sense of that every

343
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:30,940
key

344
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,980
custom dimension has it's own round trip

345
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,770
report if you're trying to group all

346
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,230
other reports in the dashboard for example

347
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,670
of for those accustomed dimensions combinations or

348
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,250
a single accustomed dimension this is probably

349
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,080
not possible in the in the dashboard

350
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,500
at least so going with an external

351
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,100
solution like

352
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,190
like a python pandas or a tableau

353
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
powerbi i meter base or something like

354
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,640
that would be the way to go

355
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,630
at least for the moment

356
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,830
i have been a quick note to

357
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,670
peter's previous explanation for every plane the

358
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,240
luxor a parrot chris is a been

359
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,070
a foreigner twice to go this way

360
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,940
and escape attempt the downtime of the

361
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,843
upgrade by afterwards replaying the saga looks

362
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,060
at

363
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,370
each tomato masala one of course has

364
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,770
to pay attention that all requests sent

365
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,200
to matomo i get requests not post

366
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,660
requests as advice of course the data

367
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,060
won't be written into every plots in

368
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,810
the server logs

369
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,740
and the mikael has another question about

370
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,890
databases speed and he says that the

371
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,800
database faith is a big issue and

372
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,835
is it possible or has someone tried

373
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:58,030
to use solar or any other database

374
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,470
for quicker queries

375
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,370
maybe that i can say something about

376
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:03,550
it

377
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,060
and as far as i know there

378
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,400
aren't any plans to support of our

379
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,349
databases because at some

380
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,589
yeah it's it's heart m to start

381
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,960
the boarding other databases when you have

382
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,940
a software that should be available for

383
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,420
your every user on a hosted system

384
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,620
and and my sql is simply the

385
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,690
mostly supported database

386
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,430
indeed the main issue i think is

387
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,520
if he wanted to add support for

388
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,590
another database and it doesn't matter if

389
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,350
it's for something a podcast is krell

390
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:48,310
or something completely different it would always

391
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,680
mean that you'd have to revise a

392
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,690
huge portion of matomo

393
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,810
and in this case it might even

394
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,970
be quicker to simply export the data

395
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,120
for matomo and if you're already rewriting

396
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,490
it from scratch or to the queries

397
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,080
in this database directly

398
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,460
and of course the other thing is

399
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,440
if it would be a writer a

400
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,630
huge portion of matomo to support other

401
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,930
databases data may be more specialized for

402
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,040
analytics data is that either both vashon

403
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,500
said that would differ quite a lot

404
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,750
huge lever to need to be maintained

405
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,380
in the future

406
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,330
aa which is really hard to do

407
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,300
or to myra credit come with only

408
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,430
my credit compatible version would have to

409
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,530
be dropped but this would mean that

410
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,020
nearly everyone who can at the moment

411
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,360
simply installing about amanda sava using my

412
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,490
squirrel yet to be able to something

413
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,710
like this are able to have major

414
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,540
issues continuing to use moto

415
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,030
when does the future so because of

416
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,730
all of this i think it won't

417
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
change in the near future yeah i've

418
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,421
had my tumor will be my credit

419
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,440
and maria depay only

420
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,300
an interesting question by pizza makers is

421
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,699
are there any ideas about integrating a

422
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:09,400
half that i have that side carbon

423
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,430
calculator which myth says how much impact

424
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,290
your website has on the planet it

425
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,030
could be a unique selling point for

426
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,470
potential new users

427
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,850
if no one else has something to

428
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,650
say about this i think this is

429
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,169
one of the use cases servitors would

430
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,480
be a really nice matomo plugin because

431
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,000
it's something only a few people would

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,530
be interested in but it would be

433
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,810
a nice feature for them and it's

434
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,770
something you can

435
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,130
quite easily to put a round of

436
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,240
matomo without having to modify something or

437
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,130
of the qr code so this would

438
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,880
be a nice a simple plugin and

439
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,250
if someone gets around to over the

440
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,810
air programming it it will be really

441
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:57,370
nice if they could publish it on

442
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,930
the marketplace i think

443
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,490
in the meantime maybe a question about

444
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,120
her translation how does the translation process

445
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,690
back in matomo hire if a hooker

446
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,810
if i there either if haematoma isn't

447
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,180
completely translated in a language i speak

448
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:21,755
or if i notice a typo or

449
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:24,665
sentence that doesn't really make sense in

450
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:26,915
the matomo how can i fix this

451
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,345
how can i report this maybe stefan

452
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:30,755
has something to say about this

453
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:38,225
mv recently and switched our translation platform

454
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,705
to contribute to and all our translations

455
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:45,395
are currently hosted on replicate it's another

456
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:49,775
open source software to maintain translations and

457
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,025
yeah everyone can em suggest

458
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:54,425
or change the translations there to any

459
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:58,235
language m and from there m the

460
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:02,975
translations are automatically pushed to our github

461
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:07,625
repository am and will later be included

462
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,815
in any new release of matomo or

463
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:11,165
any of our plugins

464
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:23,195
okay then

465
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:28,625
a bit more analytic surpise question from

466
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,665
a reverse is sir

467
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:34,715
they're currently using matomo more in order

468
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:37,955
to safer page that they interpreted what

469
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:40,445
they like to but we like to

470
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,575
be able to categorize the pages based

471
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:44,495
on his department and the data for

472
00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:46,625
this is already in the page and

473
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,965
could you please let us know how

474
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:50,075
to proceed

475
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:54,935
this one is is basically what you

476
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:57,545
can do is if the information is

477
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,765
already there you should be able to

478
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:02,045
store those kind of input within custom

479
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:05,495
dimensions and then basically also be able

480
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:07,116
to two seconds on this later on

481
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:09,605
as well in the tumor would recommend

482
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,348
to start

483
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:14,441
measuring it together with with the default

484
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,536
page view tracking and also adds to

485
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:20,225
some certain custom dimension tracking with with

486
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:21,755
the given values that you have for

487
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:24,543
the given departments and store in the

488
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,195
air and then you are able to

489
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:29,855
filter it segment is or create custom

490
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,505
reports with it as you wish

491
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:36,365
yeah it should be easy be easily

492
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:39,995
doable with the the technology typically you

493
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:42,515
can just sell silkair there's the sir

494
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:44,315
element on the page which isn't the

495
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:47,645
future under fatah was just given html

496
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:50,825
attribute so they can gallop this given

497
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:51,711
attribute that they

498
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:54,965
insult within the custom dimensions fitted in

499
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:59,915
the matter more custom valuable configuration valuable

500
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:02,186
within the tech manager and every tended

501
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:04,505
to pages going to be loaded as

502
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:06,275
this given element is on the page

503
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:07,625
is going to grab it and put

504
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,545
it as a custom they mention and

505
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:11,915
then it will slice your cat

506
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:12,935
finger is a cutting

507
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:19,355
perhaps also as an important comment on

508
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:23,105
exactly this problem is from the performance

509
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:27,005
view of things and you should always

510
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,405
tried to put as much business complexity

511
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:32,375
in in the trekking runtime so try

512
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:34,235
to put as much complexity as

513
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:38,855
possible from your data reporting and dashboard

514
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:42,509
reporting and to segment definitions etc tried

515
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:43,955
to put it into the tech manager

516
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:44,675
because

517
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:47,913
if you have to filter for accustomed

518
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:50,435
dimension it is very quick it is

519
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:55,205
very performance very effective and also the

520
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:59,285
the underlying my sql queries and if

521
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:01,895
you for example have your segment definition

522
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:04,835
and grouping one hundred a page your

523
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:05,255
else

524
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,825
to to try to to define your

525
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:12,395
your branch or something else some page

526
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:15,035
grouping of your segment it will be

527
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:17,855
very ineffective and slow so try always

528
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,955
to to do as much as possible

529
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,045
in the tech manager with custom dimensions

530
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:26,105
and track some events with extra data

531
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:29,705
and so your performance days are

532
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:31,145
says good

533
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:43,025
yeah just noticed that i missed the

534
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:46,235
question a bit above from melody that

535
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:50,015
they have for problems aggregating certain reports

536
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:52,115
for month liver parts of your data

537
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,395
then to a daily reports in the

538
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:57,272
intent of such report and to which

539
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:57,525
a

540
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,795
actions could we take to analyze the

541
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:01,775
problem so i figure this is something

542
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:04,145
that's hard to do to a genuine

543
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:06,905
guy spot were how can one approach

544
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,545
such an issue or how what is

545
00:25:09,545 --> 00:25:11,855
the easy way to get in the

546
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:15,185
direction of the issue how to start

547
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:15,935
troubleshooting

548
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:27,035
so perhaps i was just start on

549
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:30,005
on trying to answer that do well

550
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:32,915
the troubleshooting probably starts

551
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:34,685
with

552
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:39,005
yup and making clear which part of

553
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:42,455
the system makes this error so probably

554
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:45,395
one thing to to keep in mind

555
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:48,725
is that the archiving could be could

556
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:52,955
fail on the month's monthly archives mostly

557
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:55,865
mostly this is the case when the

558
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,685
memory limit is reached so you will

559
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:00,515
have to search in the server log

560
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:04,145
files for errors in the archiving process

561
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:06,965
when you have a look so if

562
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,735
you are using the cron job and

563
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:10,775
so you should make sure that you

564
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:14,015
disable the browser archiving and i think

565
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:16,025
we can attach some some links to

566
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:17,975
to that page later on in the

567
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,345
chat also to that you can make

568
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,325
sure that you enabled the cronjob for

569
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:24,245
the as in cronus or cutting of

570
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:26,915
data and then you can also read

571
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:30,305
on that page how to how to

572
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:34,775
lock the things that disgruntled writes to

573
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,185
the console how to

574
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:37,655
plug it into the into a file

575
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:40,235
and then analyze the that file for

576
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,765
errors in the monthly archive generation and

577
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:47,645
yeah that's that's probably in ninety percent

578
00:26:47,645 --> 00:26:51,005
of the cases the problem that the

579
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:53,255
archiving shop is failing for some reason

580
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,135
that's one general i think it could

581
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:56,345
at www

582
00:26:56,345 --> 00:27:00,215
vice if the rear to issues with

583
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:03,335
the reports maybe check the output of

584
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:06,365
the archiving process if you are using

585
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:08,255
a cone shop talk regularly call it

586
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:10,685
or because then it can be quite

587
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:13,085
verbose and the awesome time it that

588
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,555
your venture can add to make it

589
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:16,505
even more verbose and sometime

590
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,545
you can find something beard or some

591
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:21,185
violence into which sir i could hint

592
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:22,715
to in which direction to look

593
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:28,115
bearish a shot question from nicholas who

594
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:31,415
has problems with the heatmaps and before

595
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:35,075
i quickly recommend you to send a

596
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,265
quick email about it to the premium

597
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:39,845
plugin support team they can help you

598
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:41,765
with this probably quite easily

599
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:46,025
then another question from caesar because we

600
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:48,695
talked about get and post requests previously

601
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:50,735
if there is a way to switch

602
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:51,935
all requests to get

603
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,235
i can say something on that and

604
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:57,905
it em by default and the matomo

605
00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:01,115
tracking users and send beacon from the

606
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:03,455
browser which uses a post request you

607
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:06,275
can either disable this was the method

608
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:09,605
disable always use speaking or something like

609
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,334
that or you can force them the

610
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:13,083
request

611
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:16,175
the method with set request method bosom

612
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:19,505
should be javascript tracking options you can

613
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:20,795
send you the tracking code

614
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,775
the only thing to keep in mind

615
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:28,385
there is of course a data limit

616
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:30,245
of how much data can be sent

617
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:33,185
in the get request a matomo all

618
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:36,522
of all of the old versions automatically

619
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:38,480
switch to a post request if the

620
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:40,325
older data that would be simply be

621
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:42,185
too large i mean i think

622
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:43,835
it's a quite a lot of data

623
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,534
that would need to be sent for

624
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:47,375
to be the to launch it if

625
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,475
i get but if their website you're

626
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:52,625
tracking has enormously long you are also

627
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,275
something like this this is something to

628
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,975
maybe keep in mind just to mention

629
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:59,103
it this will always be the case

630
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:01,382
and if you are trekking m heatmaps

631
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:02,345
am and

632
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,895
stuff like that because it em tries

633
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:07,085
to send all the hatem m html

634
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,725
body and with a tracking request and

635
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:11,465
that is required to send put to

636
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:13,355
bed with post as get won't work

637
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:20,045
and another question by valentine or average

638
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:21,635
or was a better answer than a

639
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:23,105
title by the i just want to

640
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:24,455
mention it here and stream for the

641
00:29:24,455 --> 00:29:26,795
recording or if it is possible to

642
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,835
set the custom time for a scheduled

643
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:31,145
task for example to to stay at

644
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:33,455
the scheduled tasks should always wanted the

645
00:29:33,455 --> 00:29:34,745
night went off yamato

646
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:36,906
number of website visitors at the server

647
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:39,035
has less load or something like this

648
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:41,585
and as far as i know there

649
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:44,135
isn't yet a feature like this it

650
00:29:44,135 --> 00:29:46,055
might be something that could be added

651
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:48,035
and that a lot of people might

652
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:50,495
be interested in a back around to

653
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:52,835
have somebody to suggest that it's of

654
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,085
course you can run them at almost

655
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:58,233
casual task individually so if this is

656
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,855
something you cap out you could

657
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,493
if i set up a thing separate

658
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:04,865
corn chops for older scheduled task and

659
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:05,345
matomo

660
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,865
i have been questioned by a team

661
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:14,615
kata it said there are plans to

662
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:17,885
introduce filtering much like what exists in

663
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:21,935
google analytics because segments stone to cover

664
00:30:22,145 --> 00:30:24,605
always sets a which doesn't suit that

665
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:25,205
purpose

666
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:34,970
the thighs i know there is actually

667
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,190
an issue on get up but em

668
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:39,500
i don't know the current state of

669
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,720
it but i guess it isn't bland

670
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,380
currently

671
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,780
yeah and i'm sharing the same and

672
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,880
so i don't have the answer here

673
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,850
so for the guys who are not

674
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,550
familiar with google analytics typically no matter

675
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,470
more you get to a different way

676
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,750
of walking so zef laker within the

677
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,120
global set settings you can exclude by

678
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,710
a p address and

679
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,840
by adding for example the spam tracking

680
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,970
prevention you can exclude bay countries

681
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,480
but you don't have as much flexibility

682
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,670
as the google analytics filter which i

683
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,346
including those two dimensions that they just

684
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:19,700
to mention including as well user agent

685
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,620
i forgot in google antics you of

686
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,620
all your zoho dimensions possibility to use

687
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,910
us filter to come in

688
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,020
to filter out are included within a

689
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,290
within a within google analytics and he

690
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,240
stood at sir currently met and does

691
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,284
not offer them orlin and i don't

692
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:39,710
know zeph plan of doing it yeah

693
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,140
i posted a link to the get

694
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,270
up is sure stefan refer to if

695
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,214
you're interested entitled this topic i too

696
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:47,150
i command you to

697
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,100
a look at upper there

698
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:52,580
in the meantime while i am looking

699
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,369
for the chapter i am for question

700
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:56,569
questioner i think to her always been

701
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,980
twisting a tour or interesting or to

702
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,380
hear is how can one contribute to

703
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,800
matomo either a how can i report

704
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,020
a notice of back in matomo how

705
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,430
can reported on

706
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,470
or if i know how to program

707
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,600
how can i even fix it myself

708
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,520
okay so hey a fellow sufferer i

709
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,470
think the better the thing i mentioned

710
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,260
in the beginning so if you're just

711
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,900
have a vague issue and are not

712
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,970
sure of what is exactly going wrong

713
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,890
the easiest thing is to ask on

714
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,040
the forearm and to that way find

715
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,390
out a better low savage

716
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,120
exactly the issue what is going wrong

717
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,580
if you know it or if that

718
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,830
sir and if you know exactly what

719
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,560
is going wrong and over how someone

720
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,280
can reproduce it then a new criminal

721
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,890
code then you can echo directly to

722
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,330
get up and create to get up

723
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,490
his shepherd of crosser

724
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,740
the things that sets how to reproduce

725
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,540
it makes it a lot easier to

726
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,790
understand the issue makes it a lot

727
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,610
easier to fix it because er oftentimes

728
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,670
sir it's obvious for the person writing

729
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,630
a github issue to know there it's

730
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,760
obvious for them votre they are talking

731
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
about but if you're not

732
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,970
they're up to date on what they

733
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,610
are doing it's quite hard to understand

734
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,430
it and is adding steps to exactly

735
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,650
reproduce the issue makes it a lot

736
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,080
easier to understand the issue and in

737
00:33:27,136 --> 00:33:29,120
that way also a lot easier to

738
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,250
fire developer to the packet and then

739
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,760
fix it

740
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,763
and of course if you're you're a

741
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:39,290
developer yourself and know how to fix

742
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,020
it then at the easiest figures of

743
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,020
crawford to change the code created importantly

744
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,980
cost if the change and to contribute

745
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,420
a tumor tumors yourself

746
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,587
the pune if you're a developer but

747
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,350
don't know it they're not that familiar

748
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,810
with moto more than you can also

749
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:04,070
go to their matomo developer page which

750
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,850
has a

751
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,780
great pager about how to get started

752
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,690
with the code base of matomo and

753
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,670
how to set up a local motto

754
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,340
more into the development instance which makes

755
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,560
it a lot easier to contribute code

756
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,100
changes

757
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,540
can a ma analytics or a related

758
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,080
question about funnels me before stefan arkansas

759
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,310
am

760
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,370
at least see the question itself lie

761
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:39,260
repeated for people who are watching the

762
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,500
recording or talking about funded refers how

763
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,750
does it for homeless at whacking if

764
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,489
you have a family like this where

765
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:48,350
the separate first step is entered them

766
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,560
going to a conversion directly does it

767
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,360
get to be fearless in the steps

768
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,550
afterwards as before

769
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,659
article conversion

770
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,820
maybe on all of the fun have

771
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,830
something to say about it i'm not

772
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,840
that familiar referred i can't really help

773
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,380
here advice the question would again be

774
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,910
to ask the support team

775
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,770
will you you can of course set

776
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,480
your goal in there and the conversion

777
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,160
will be set in the second step

778
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,230
when when it's needs directly being a

779
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,860
chiefs

780
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,760
and it depends whether the fifth is

781
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,300
also being set as a conversion in

782
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,030
your goal configuration you can set it

783
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,410
to allow to cool

784
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,830
to make a conversion multiple times were

785
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,060
to do it only once within the

786
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,550
given this is the kind of things

787
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,730
matter of figuration was

788
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,770
as soon as someone

789
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,080
moves across additional steps it depends on

790
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,180
whether certain steps are required or not

791
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,000
to check whether this instance has been

792
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,280
achieved and it really depends on your

793
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,597
goal configuration settings

794
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,270
a question by a mass alert i

795
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,400
think a lot of people are asking

796
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,070
is they have a website and they

797
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,530
want to collect a reader for your

798
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,840
feedback so feedback by the people visiting

799
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,390
the website something like how does the

800
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,910
story make you feel and

801
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:28,130
it makes sense to collect the state

802
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:30,350
and moto moto moto connected to the

803
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,600
outer data and can't could this be

804
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,180
realistically be implemented on top of moto

805
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,070
more of a moto my state store

806
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,220
and of course he could to a

807
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:43,580
program something i kiss rather easily yourself

808
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,190
if you're to the user interface pot

809
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,620
yourself and then sent that data for

810
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,260
example a ser or custom event or

811
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,440
something like this but by chen sir

812
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,197
we have a talk tomorrow by thomas

813
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,870
a person is talking about a plugin

814
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,960
they developed which dusk right exactly this

815
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,050
so richer it's a feedback or feature

816
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,350
to her

817
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,740
website you're using matomo so you might

818
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,380
want to listen to this talk tomorrow

819
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,130
yeah i added the link within the

820
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:19,160
the chat and i think doomed focus

821
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,130
yourself on the the fallen which is

822
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,900
under the patronage that i that they

823
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,630
show you because a sink that's in

824
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,240
the link that that you sent your

825
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,790
like eight different buttons a sing that

826
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,680
you can add with this plugin

827
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,890
custom layout in order to have more

828
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,080
than a than two buttons and twelve

829
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,000
eight like yours are the best thing

830
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,950
is yes of course westward to thomas

831
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,930
but the walks in sp for me

832
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,790
two years on display again as though

833
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,350
that's going to be a pregnant pitcher

834
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,870
saw that sir mod the path where

835
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,040
your eyes go down let's say that

836
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,810
the it's always

837
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,120
good to to discuss wheeler with him

838
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,140
too scene factor was edited and the

839
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,270
spirit behind and the and i have

840
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,920
the chance to avert to assist to

841
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,100
several conferences at the move that maidens

842
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,930
it's really impressive and great feature

843
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,341
he may be in the meantime with

844
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,720
her mom marketing really or usa related

845
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,450
question that i get a lot of

846
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,840
times is there that now that there

847
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,540
is matomo tech manager what are the

848
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,150
differences between using matomo direct

849
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,460
your love way and the using matomo

850
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,270
tag manager

851
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,310
so i i could say a few

852
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,120
words about that

853
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,630
so basically or generally are both things

854
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,250
are working and will work in the

855
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,060
future so that's the important thing to

856
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,820
know at first but mostly also with

857
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,660
bigger teams working on an matomo also

858
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,590
more than one on

859
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,440
analyst and if you have more than

860
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,370
one requirement collected for tracking capabilities and

861
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:16,280
everything and the tech manager makes more

862
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,820
sense than the legacy tracking code and

863
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,000
the reason for that is probably if

864
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,750
you want to extend your your trekking

865
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,910
the concept and you want to have

866
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,300
more tracking features collect accustomed dimensions events

867
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,080
and have some behavioral stuff included into

868
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,320
the tracking code for example if it's

869
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,630
just a simple thing like trekking clicks

870
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,300
on on a call to action button

871
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,910
or some kind of other interaction stuff

872
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,540
and you would always have to have

873
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,390
a release cycle and close contact to

874
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,330
the developer of the of the website

875
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,040
to just give him the code and

876
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,130
prepare everything and he has to included

877
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,690
in the website and then you have

878
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,430
to release a new version of the

879
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,260
website to include the new version of

880
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,040
the tracking code

881
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,500
and then in worst case you have

882
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,720
made an arrow anywhere audio you need

883
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,570
more data you have a stakeholder that

884
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,110
called with a with a feature request

885
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:19,970
in the last second and it didn't

886
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,510
bring it into the current sprint or

887
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,270
something like that and so it's quite

888
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,940
a nightmare to maintain this this kind

889
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,220
of code with a tech miniature code

890
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,940
and it's mostly or most of the

891
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,870
things you can do

892
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:39,645
the tech miniature configuration in the generic

893
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,215
user interface so this is this is

894
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:44,925
not a free ticket for everyone to

895
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:48,525
to do everything with tags and release

896
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:50,625
new container versions and stuff because you

897
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,815
can break the site with that ah

898
00:40:52,845 --> 00:40:54,465
so there should be a workflow for

899
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:56,535
that but basically it is

900
00:40:56,595 --> 00:40:58,755
your time to market for the for

901
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,885
the trekking is much better than with

902
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:04,125
the legacy code and also the maintain

903
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,645
abilities is much better and you can

904
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:09,495
feed information that you can't collect from

905
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:12,615
the from the html directly you can

906
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:15,105
gather of your data layer so that's

907
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:16,673
the the single point

908
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,065
of a connection between you and the

909
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:21,975
developer or the cms the data layer

910
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:24,885
and you have to ask the developer

911
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:27,105
to pass over information that you can

912
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,692
get from the html and then to

913
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:31,215
composite over to the tech manager and

914
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:33,825
process everything with it so it makes

915
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,865
things and life much easier here

916
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,495
that was the truth noticed if you're

917
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:41,565
really interested in this topic you might

918
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,335
want to leave the session right now

919
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,405
and go to the other lifestream boom

920
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:48,855
because thomas person is currently talking about

921
00:41:48,945 --> 00:41:50,895
matomo tag men are trying to basics

922
00:41:50,895 --> 00:41:51,285
of it

923
00:41:52,665 --> 00:41:56,385
not in addition you have also everything

924
00:41:56,385 --> 00:42:00,105
in one place and every tracking scripts

925
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:02,955
you do you know where the tracking

926
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:05,625
script is implemented and so on and

927
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:09,045
if you do a relaunch you don't

928
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:11,595
have to make a list of all

929
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,615
the tracking scr

930
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:16,035
crypts in page path five hundred and

931
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:18,315
so on until you you can only

932
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:21,675
open the technica contain i'd see which

933
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,085
scripts you're using

934
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:28,420
sometimes it's easier to troubleshoot everything up

935
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,295
with the development or debug view and

936
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:36,465
you have some templates some you can

937
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:38,655
fill in so you don't have to

938
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:42,105
code something if you're not familiar with

939
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:44,295
coding until you can use

940
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,775
use some templates and to integrate some

941
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:52,035
external services and yeah and if you

942
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:54,705
want to rollback you have an version

943
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,225
control and i think it's easier to

944
00:42:57,225 --> 00:43:01,665
roll back tack miniature version then the

945
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:04,455
release version so i think

946
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:07,875
in time you can easy rollback of

947
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:11,235
the russian intact miniature and the like

948
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:13,215
up to say you have to go

949
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,555
to the developer and say okay can

950
00:43:15,555 --> 00:43:20,295
you reverse please the last version and

951
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:24,375
so it's it's easier and yeah sometimes

952
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:24,615
you can

953
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:28,635
can see you have also documented who

954
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:32,265
changes what barricade in the development you

955
00:43:32,265 --> 00:43:34,455
have this too but there you have

956
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:38,235
the use and permission management in one

957
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:42,585
place and i think sum up this

958
00:43:42,675 --> 00:43:44,775
are all very good feature

959
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:47,145
us and i think er in mind

960
00:43:47,475 --> 00:43:52,065
i would never integrate tracking scripts without

961
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:55,725
and container without matomo tech ledger or

962
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:59,685
something else something or some other tech

963
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:00,345
managers

964
00:44:08,715 --> 00:44:11,489

965
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:16,005
