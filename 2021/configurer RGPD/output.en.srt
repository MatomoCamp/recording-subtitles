00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello everyone, it is currently 13h00 and I am ready to start the conference that I had planned for today, which is called How to configure Matomo in the respect of the RGPD.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Before starting, I just want to make sure that the sound is ok. Frédéric, do you hear me correctly?

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, perfectly.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am going to start this conference, which is scheduled from 13h00 to 13h45, including the different questions and answers that each of you may have in relation to this issue.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Do not hesitate to go to chat.matomocamp.org to register if you have not already done so, and once there, do not hesitate to ask questions in the room that is scheduled for this event.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Frédéric, who is the moderator of this conference, will ask these questions, either directly or at the end of the conference.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can also ask questions throughout the MatomoCamp on this particular issue, whether today or tomorrow, since the Q&A room remains open.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will perhaps, for the needs of the conference, keep a little more of a passing band and stop my camera.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The idea in this conference is first that I introduce myself, then that I present to you the objectives of this conference,

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then to give you a definition of what the audience analysis is, since in a way it is what we are talking about today within the framework of the RGPD.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Then I will go over a definition of what personal data is in the sense of the RGPD.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then I will deal with the exemption of consent with Matomo, which concerns the majority of the cases for which people will use Matomo and how to do that in respect of the RGPD.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then I will address a part that we see quite few.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How do we do when we want to deal with personal data with Matomo and that we must recover the consent of the user?

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I will conclude this conference.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
To introduce myself quickly, my name is Ronan Chardonneau.

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was lucky and honored to work for the Matomo team.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When we say the Matomo team, it means a lot of things.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I mainly worked for Inocraft from 2017 to 2019, which is the private company that is the main contributor to the development of Matomo.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In fact, it is not exactly true that I worked for the Matomo team, I worked for the Inocraft team.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But the Inocraft team being the main contributor to the Matomo project, in a way, through my work that I was able to do within the Inocraft company,

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was able to contribute to the development of the Matomo software and the Matomo software, in a way, I contributed a lot as a volunteer,

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
especially through the dissemination of knowledge, of tutorials that you can find on the Internet,

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
either on my Pertube channel, either on my YouTube channel, or also on different MOOCs that I was able to create,

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
including that of the Floss Marketing School, or also a MOOC that I was able to create on the Zest platform of knowledge, which is an association for non-profit purposes,

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
which releases tutorials, knowledge around different technologies or other knowledge.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What is interesting is that when I worked for Inocraft, from 2017 to 2019,

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was the person who was in charge of the implementation of the RGPD within the company.

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And that allowed me to see a lot of things.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And the idea is, through this conference, and also the experience that I was able to have after leaving Inocraft,

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to be able to share a little bit of all this in today's conference.

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I am a trainee and independent consultant on Matomo, formerly it was not Matomo, it was called P-Week.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Since 2010, I have been one of the very first people to have a certain way to bet on P-Week, on Matomo,

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and to have decided to build a whole structure, a whole business around that,

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
which is in particular the subject of a conference that will take place just after, from 2pm to 3pm, which I will do in English,

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
where I will explain how to develop an economic activity around Matomo.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is my main job, I have been a trainee and independent consultant on Matomo since 2010,

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and I am also the head of social and e-danger conferences that I have been in digital marketing,

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
now we call it digital marketing, since 2012.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In fact, I am training students in digital marketing, and for the past few years now,

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I have been trying to bring them knowledge in digital marketing using free software,

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and Matomo is naturally the one I am going to talk about the most.

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I have a third activity that is quite recent, which is that I am an international expert on the subject of free software

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
from the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation,

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
on the subject of open science.

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It consists of going abroad and being the spokesperson, the ambassador of the government

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
to explain what the government's policy is in terms of open science,

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and in particular what is the policy that is carried out by the government

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
around the release of software produced by researchers

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
that in a certain way must be in free access and under license.

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So this is a project that is brand new for me,

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I may have the opportunity to talk about it in other conferences later.

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And I am also the creator of a platform called Flossmarketingschool.com

54
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that I strongly advise you to go and consult,

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
it is an internet site on which I actually release all the courses that I provide at e-danger,

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
these are courses in free access, you have tutorials,

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
textual explanations, you also have exercises,

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and it's really great if you want to educate yourself in free software and digital marketing.

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So the objective of the conference will be the following,

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:00,000
is that you discover how to learn how to get in concrete conformity with Matomo for the RGPD,

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
so I will share my screen, I will show you the different contents,

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will show you the back-end of Matomo,

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
what are the options through which you have to navigate to be in conformity.

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you have any questions, feel free to go to chat.matomocamp.org

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and ask your questions, since it is through this intermediary that I will be able to help you even more,

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to be closer to your needs.

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So I will now advance a little, I will come back to this link a little later,

68
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
which is actually the key to the conference,

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
it is a guide that LACNIL has put online and which explains why in a certain way

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and how software editors can be exempt from consent,

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
so it will be very interesting since it is a list of factors that are indicated

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
that explains how a software editor can be exempt from consent

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and how we can collect data on users directly

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
without having offered them an acceptance list.

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So the prerequisites for following this conference are the following.

76
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I consider that for this conference, most of you already know the RGPD,

77
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
so if this is not the case, I strongly encourage you to go to the official link,

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
eur-lex.europa.eu,

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
on which you will find the official text of the RGPD which is 88 pages long.

80
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Its reading and comprehension, to have it done,

81
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
require half a day of work or at least time to reflect, to read.

82
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It is worth the investment in time, since it also allows you to be well educated,

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
well trained, what is the RGPD.

84
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
One of the basic rules of the RGPD is that the text must be readable and understandable to all,

85
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
so we are not on a document that needs to be BAC plus 15 to be able to read it.

86
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And it's really very interesting because it allows you to see everything in the RGPD,

87
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
although not everything is concerned with everything that the RGPD says,

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but it allows you to know what the RGPD is by a source of information

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
that has not been interpreted by a third that comes directly from the EU.

90
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And that has its advantage.

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Then I strongly recommend you to follow MOOCs that are related to the RGPD application or the RGPD in general.

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Unfortunately, the MOOC edited by Acneel is currently in the process of reissue,

93
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
so if you go to it, it's a shame because the old version was very well done,

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think it could have gone online.

95
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You will find it on this link because there is one day or the other where they will update it,

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but it is good to know that they are in the process of renovation.

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
However, I know that when I started to educate myself on the RGPD,

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Acneel had not yet released its online MOOC.

99
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I had followed a training course by a Dutch university

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
which also apparently reviewed its MOOC.

101
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It seems to me that it was this one, but I'm not sure.

102
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I put the link there as an indicator.

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think you can easily type MOOC RGPD on a very well-known research engine

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and easily find other MOOCs,

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but I assume that to follow this conference,

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you already know what a MINIMA is than the RGPD.

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Before directly attacking the conformity of Matomo in the RGPD framework,

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
let's go back to the fundamentals and basically explain what we are talking about.

109
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We are talking about Matomo.

110
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What is Matomo? It is a solution in audience analysis.

111
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The big question is what is a solution in audience analysis?

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A solution in audience analysis is nothing more or less than a system of information.

113
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It is just a database.

114
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You have to understand what Matomo is.

115
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It is a database.

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It is a place that stores data.

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What does it contain?

118
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It contains traces of exchange between two computers,

119
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
between the computer that will be the client,

120
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
that is to say the visitor or the user,

121
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
if you have a mobile application, if you have an internet.

122
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Taking a website is perhaps much simpler.

123
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You have a visitor who arrives on your website.

124
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Your website is hosted on what?

125
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It is hosted on what is called a server.

126
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You have a request that is made by a computer, that is to say a client,

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and you have in front of you another computer that responds to it, which is called the server.

128
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
These two entities communicate via what?

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They communicate via what we call HTTP requests.

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What do these HTTP requests contain?

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They contain information that is standard in communications between two computers,

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
which are the IP address of the client computer,

133
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the time and date at which the request is made,

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the page that is requested,

135
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
so the page that is requested is also a URL,

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and via the URL the title of the page is also recovered.

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The way in which the user came to the site,

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
how he or she knew it in a certain way,

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
which is called the URL reference,

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is also transmitted behind everything that is going to be screen resolution.

141
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Also through what is called the user agent,

142
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the language of the browser is also transmitted.

143
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And behind a little more information on the browser,

144
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
such as its version or the operating system on which it is used.

145
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All this to tell you that this information is stored in a database.

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will maybe share my screen, it may be more explicit directly,

147
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and that's why I think that Matomo is pretty great.

148
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
At least at Matomo you see what the database looks like.

149
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Frédéric, do you see my screen well, what I share?

150
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, absolutely.

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Typically, this is the database of Matomo.

152
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is what you have to install the day you install Matomo on the server of your choice.

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We must not forget that Matomo, what makes it strong,

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
compared to all the other software on the market,

155
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
is that it is a free software.

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It is a software that you directly recover on a site,

157
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
namely matomo.org.

158
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then, once you have this software,

159
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
you decide on the server on which you are going to install it.

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And when you install it on a server,

161
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
you have to install what is called a database and it is there, our database.

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is where you have these famous HTTP requests

163
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
which contain data that have been extracted

164
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and which have then been inserted into the database.

165
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is where we see, for example, the identifier of the visit,

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the site on which you deployed Matomo.

167
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You will then have everything that will be the IP address of the user.

168
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You will have the location that will be represented here.

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The information that we see here is not necessarily the most explicit,

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
but if we go a little more to the right,

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
we have directly information that we are more used to seeing,

172
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
namely the reference, namely the language of the navigator,

173
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
namely what type of engine is used,

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
basically which navigator, the version of the navigator, etc.

175
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In the end, everything is recorded here in this famous database.

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
A solution for audience analysis, I remind you,

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
is just a database that contains the basic information

178
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that has exchanges between a navigator, a client computer, and a server.

179
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
To make it simple, what are the personal data collected by default in Matomo?

180
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
In reality, in these famous personal data that we have, we don't have much.

181
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Probably the most intrusive that we can have is the famous IP address

182
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
which also allows us to identify generally a home,

183
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
since the IP address is provided by your Internet access provider.

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But in reality, it is especially dangerous if within a database,

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you only have one person, since in this case,

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
it would mean that this IP address, at least one person,

187
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
your Internet access provider can know who is behind,

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
which is naturally less the case when in a database you have more individuals.

189
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
All this to tell you that already, in Matomo,

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you don't have any information that is very personal.

191
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Now, however, what you need to know is that in Matomo,

192
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you can extend its data collection power with specific monitoring codes,

193
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
which are the object of a documentation found on developer.matomo.org,

194
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
which is represented by, for example, personalized dimensions,

195
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
which will be information, data that you can assign to your visitors,

196
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
which allows you to know more about them.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
These data do not come from the Holy Spirit, naturally,

198
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
they come because they are already probably present on your website.

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
For example, you have an e-commerce site,

200
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and on your e-commerce site, a person, when creating an account,

201
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
will indicate, for example, his name and first name.

202
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This information is stored in the database linked to your website,

203
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and you can, through personalized dimensions,

204
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
come and collect, for example, this data,

205
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and match it with the visit.

206
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But this will really be an action that will be done by the website editor,

207
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the person who controls it on the source code,

208
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and who will decide, of his own free will, to be able to put this personal data.

209
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Same thing with the user ID.

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is the same.

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is a code that specifically allows you to recognize the user.

212
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But this is the same.

213
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can recognize the user only if he or she has given you the information.

214
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This will typically be the case when a person is going to log in on a site.

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I take for example the example of an e-commerce site.

216
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If a person logs in on an e-commerce site,

217
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
it is that at some point, he or she will decide to create an account on your platform,

218
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and when the person creates an account,

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
she will give you, or in any case you,

220
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
you will make a kind of system to be able to put an ID.

221
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Generally, the ID will be the nickname,

222
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that the person will have decided to create when he or she has created the account,

223
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
which will be used to create the user ID.

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
After that, this is more of a point of surveillance.

225
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Be careful because the way you integrate the code into Matomo

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
can be done through plugins.

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is especially the case when you use, for example,

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
plugins already developed for WordPress to integrate Matomo,

229
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
or PrestaShop, or whatever you want.

230
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In fact, these plugins, you have to imagine that you have integration teams,

231
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
you have developers who create specific features

232
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
that are often very requested for these CMS,

233
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and which can automatically include the collection of personal data.

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You can imagine, typically, the case of e-commerce.

235
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You develop a store on PrestaShop,

236
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
or you develop a store on WordPress.

237
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Naturally, if you put Matomo,

238
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you are waiting for Matomo to collect information

239
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
about e-commerce, shopping cart, etc.

240
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
By using these plugins,

241
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
it is not said that by default,

242
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
these plugins do not directly integrate the functions of this e-commerce,

243
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
which can be considered,

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
in any case, this is the case, we will come back to it later,

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
by LACNIL as being intrusive data,

246
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
in any case, which requires the user's prior agreement to be able to collect,

247
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
since naturally, through an electronic transaction,

248
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we can indirectly know who is the person who is hiding behind the command.

249
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And then, naturally, in Matomo,

250
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
we can find personal data that comes up when your site is poorly designed.

251
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We can imagine, for example, a website for which you have URLs,

252
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and the URLs in question contain the name and first name of an individual,

253
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
or an identifier, something like that.

254
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is especially the case on certain sites,

255
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
when you connect to a back-office,

256
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
sometimes the developers had the bad idea of putting the user's identifier in the URL,

257
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and when this is the case, naturally, when this URL is loaded,

258
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
it sends the information directly to Matomo.

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But by default, normally, in Matomo,

260
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the most intrusive information that you are going to get,

261
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
it will be the IP address.

262
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
All this to say that by default,

263
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
there is not much you should be afraid of

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
to be in compliance with the RGPD,

265
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
even if we will see it just after,

266
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
there are still a few little things that will have to be done.

267
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
On the other hand, where you should be well concerned with this RGPD problem,

268
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
this is all the diapo that I have just gone through.

269
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Naturally, if you have specific codes,

270
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
there you get personal data,

271
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and there you risk much more my opinion of the law,

272
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
if there are things that are...

273
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
My data is controlled by you.

274
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So, to remember that it is very important,

275
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in France, the RGPD application is done via the ACNIL authority.

276
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This is not a small information,

277
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
that is to say that I made the choice today to do this conference in French,

278
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
simply because for me it is quite simple

279
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
to be able to verify the ACNIL doc and present it to you.

280
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
However, what I am telling you here for France,

281
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
it does not work naturally if you have a website

282
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that is for a country abroad,

283
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
since when it comes to abroad,

284
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
there is no longer the ACNIL that is cold,

285
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
so you have to look at each time

286
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
which is the equivalent of the private life commission

287
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
in the country you are aiming for.

288
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We can imagine a French company

289
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
that develops a site for Germany,

290
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
there it goes that it is not the ACNIL rule

291
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
that will have to be followed to put Matomo in conformity,

292
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
it will be directly that of the German authority.

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Hence the interest during the MatomoCamp

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
to be able to exchange with people from Germany,

295
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
it allows you to know a little more about what is being done.

296
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
For this conference, I will just talk about the Franco-French market.

297
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So, what does ACNIL say

298
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
in relation to the conformity of Matomo with the RGPD?

299
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If you do not collect personal data,

300
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
then you can benefit from what is called an exemption of consent,

301
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
that is to say that you are not obliged to have explicitly

302
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
a user who comes to the site,

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
sees a banner that says,

304
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
do you accept that your data is collected?

305
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, you can do without it.

306
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This is the main reason

307
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
why webmasters come to choose Matomo.

308
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Note here that you can benefit from an exemption.

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The can is very important,

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
since naturally it will imply that the exemption is not automatic.

311
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It will be necessary to do things to be able to benefit

312
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
from this authorization of data collection

313
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
without the user's prior agreement.

314
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If you ever want to use Matomo to collect personal data,

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
so here we will see more of the case of the kind,

316
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
but in fact, I put Matomo on my site,

317
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but in fact I want to collect personal data,

318
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
such as the one I presented to you earlier,

319
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
transactions and trade.

320
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It can be information on the individual,

321
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
as I told you earlier,

322
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
it can be his IP address in full,

323
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
there you have no choice.

324
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You will also have to obtain the consent of the users.

325
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Here on solution number 2,

326
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
you are at the same level as if you were using Google Analytics

327
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
or any other solution that specifically needs the user's agreement.

328
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
As far as what you need to know and how to get along,

329
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
it is directly posted on the Acnil website,

330
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
on acnil.fr slash fr cookie autotraceur.

331
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I will talk about it in a few minutes

332
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and then show you a little bit more concretely what it looks like.

333
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Just the troll moment of the day,

334
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
be very careful at Acnil,

335
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
be vigilant when we talk about RGPD or others,

336
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
since this is a message that I sent,

337
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
this answer is the continuation of a message

338
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
that I sent about 80 days ago.

339
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
At Acnil, I agree to say that they are not a lot of staff

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and that they put time before answering.

341
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They indicate well on their site that they currently have a lot of requests

342
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and that they need an average of 60 days to be able to answer,

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
but I was quite surprised to see that I wrote to them about 80 days ago.

344
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I received an answer on Tuesday, October 26,

345
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
my question was the following,

346
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I did not see that Matomo was listed as an example of consent solution,

347
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and I simply asked them

348
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
what date Matomo will be listed as consent,

349
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and I received the answer on Tuesday, October 26,

350
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
thank you for contacting me,

351
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I would like to inform you that the Matomo tool

352
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
no longer appears in the list of solutions

353
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
without the consent of the internet users.

354
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Indeed, this tool has been removed

355
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
due to the lack of conformity in the new recommendations of Acnil.

356
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Fortunately, I did my job correctly,

357
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
it turns out that it was at least a good week that Matomo was listed as consent,

358
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
there was a conformity guide that was on the Acnil website,

359
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
but it's just that the person who answered me

360
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
had not even been on the Acnil website to check the information,

361
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
so it's pretty crazy to say wow,

362
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
they took 80 days to answer,

363
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and in addition when you need an answer, it's not good.

364
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
All this to tell you that what is called the DPO,

365
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
the Data Protection Officer,

366
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
the person in charge of respecting the private life

367
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
of users in your infrastructure,

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
in your institution, in your company,

369
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
you will always have to check by yourself,

370
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
there is a role of continuous surveillance

371
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and to always dig and look for new information.

372
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So that's all to tell you,

373
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
beware of Acnil too,

374
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
since unfortunately I think they have a lot of requests

375
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and they don't have the opportunity to follow all the files,

376
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
but Matomo is well exempt from consent

377
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and that's exactly what we're going to see now.

378
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So, I'm going to share my screen,

379
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
so I'm going to have to ask the same question again, I'm sorry.

380
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Frédéric, do you see my screen well?

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes, actually.

382
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
We are on the Acnil website, on your side?

383
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yes, exactly.

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Great, thank you very much.

385
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So, the Acnil website is very well done.

386
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You have two parts here,

387
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I am a specialist and I am a professional.

388
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The one that interests us is the one called I am a professional,

389
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
so you click here.

390
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Then you go to technology

391
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and what will interest us is Cookie and other tracers.

392
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You click on it.

393
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Once you are there,

394
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
you have different information blocks that are listed.

395
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The one that interests us is the one called Cookie Solutions

396
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
for audience measurement tools.

397
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I strongly encourage you to regularly check the Acnil website,

398
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
which has evolved quite a bit.

399
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's also the same on the Matomo.org website.

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The RGPD, even if it dates back to 2018,

401
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and we talked about it before,

402
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
we have information that goes on.

403
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So, don't hesitate every time.

404
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What was true yesterday may not necessarily be true today,

405
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
or in any case has been updated.

406
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And there, on the Acnil website,

407
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
we have the list of different audience measurement solutions

408
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that are exempted.

409
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So here, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
There, you have the list of the different solutions that are available.

411
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And there, you have the solution of Matomo Analytics version 4.

412
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This can also be important,

413
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that you need version 4 to be able to be exempted.

414
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And the configuration guide that is present here.

415
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm not going to go straight into the configuration guide.

416
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I will first present, in my opinion, what is most important.

417
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's the file.

418
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That is to say, what Acnil asks for

419
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
for a software editor to be exempt from consent.

420
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
For me, it's important that you know,

421
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
because otherwise we don't necessarily understand

422
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
why certain solutions are put forward,

423
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
why some are exempted from consent and not others.

424
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So that's the form that the software editors have to fill in.

425
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So, AT-Internet, Matomo,

426
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
any other solution you might have in mind

427
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
to be able to have the right to be exempted from consent from users.

428
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So you have a list of nine points to respect

429
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
to be able to edit the famous configuration guide

430
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that I showed you earlier.

431
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And in fact, the most important, in my opinion,

432
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
is point number one,

433
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
which directly shows that solutions such as Google Analytics

434
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
are seen badly, how they could go.

435
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So point number one,

436
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
is deactivation of any data processing for your account,

437
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
if necessary, and regardless of the purpose to follow.

438
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So what does it mean?

439
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It means that if you are a software editor,

440
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you have no choice.

441
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Either you are a free software,

442
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that is to say that you are a common good,

443
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and it's not a problem, people are free to use the software

444
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
at any time they want,

445
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
or you are obliged to be a software editor

446
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
who provides a service that is paying.

447
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
In fact, you have no choice,

448
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
because a company by definition is not there

449
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
to make money.

450
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So that's condition number one,

451
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
which is really important,

452
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
in all cases, exit Google Analytics.

453
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
In fact, they just can't even go through,

454
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
here they can't be an example of consent,

455
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
since that would mean that they provide

456
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
the service for free,

457
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
which naturally costs a lot of money

458
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
in terms of storage and data,

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and it's just not possible.

460
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Then we have all the other conditions,

461
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
which will make us open our eyes

462
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
more on the features

463
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
that we are no longer entitled to use by default

464
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
without having the consent of the users.

465
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So that's all that's going to be

466
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the deactivation of the user's cohort,

467
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the limit of the IP address collection,

468
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
so the fact that we can collect

469
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
an IP address in full,

470
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
we must pseudonymize it,

471
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
deactivation of any external data import function,

472
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
so it's not possible to do data crossings,

473
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
so to be able to inject, for example,

474
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
data by default from a CRM,

475
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to be able to have more sense

476
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
on the data we have inside Matomo,

477
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
deactivation of data exports

478
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
containing unique identifiers

479
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
or non-aggregated data,

480
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
so that's the possibility,

481
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
a little bit the opposite of this one,

482
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
it's the possibility of being able to use

483
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Matomo data to come behind,

484
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
transform other existing information systems

485
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
to be able to exploit personal data.

486
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Limitation of the tracer warehouse

487
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
to a domain or mobile application,

488
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
so that's what we call cross-tracking,

489
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
it's the fact of not being able to follow

490
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
a user from one site to another,

491
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
so that's particularly useful

492
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and we understand the interest

493
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
when you visit a cooking recipe site

494
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and you visit a car site,

495
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and the owner of these two sites is the same,

496
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
so the possibility of knowing more about you,

497
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
the possibility of being able to target you more,

498
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and share data between the different information systems,

499
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
even though you don't know

500
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
that it belongs to the same company behind.

501
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Deactivation, the ability to visualize a single browser in the tool,

502
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
so that's at its point in Matomo,

503
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
that's all that's going to be the visit journal.

504
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Any marking that allows you to retrieve personal information,

505
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
so that's going to be all identifiable,

506
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
that you can go and retrieve,

507
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and the existence of a tool

508
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
of position functionality in the cooking,

509
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
of audience measurement,

510
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
so that's what we call Locked Out,

511
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
which probably some of you already know,

512
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
you didn't give your consent,

513
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
even if your solution is exempt from consent,

514
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
you still have to provide a mechanism of opposition.

515
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So let's now go to Matomo specifically,

516
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
what it is for the confirmation with the RGPD,

517
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
so we have the little configuration guide

518
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
that we find here,

519
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
which is rather well done,

520
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
even though most of us

521
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
have minds that are always a little bit tortured,

522
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
we are always going to dig,

523
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
dig, dig even more,

524
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
but in the state it is really,

525
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
it already gives the right directives to follow.

526
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So there they tell us two things,

527
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Matomo in self-guided mode,

528
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
or Matomo in cloud mode,

529
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
for this presentation I will just consider

530
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
the self-guided part,

531
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
not the cloud part.

532
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What changes,

533
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
and if there is the cloud part,

534
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
your DPO has above all the responsibility

535
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
to link here what we call the DPA.

536
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This cloud version,

537
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
it is specific to the cloud

538
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
that the Matomo team proposes,

539
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
so matomo.cloud,

540
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and naturally does not concern

541
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
other hosts that you could use,

542
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
such as Ghandi Le Fay,

543
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Emprunt Digital Le Fay,

544
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Digitalista B which is also in MatomoCamp,

545
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Le Fay,

546
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
so that's why I'm not going to talk too much

547
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
about part B,

548
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm going to talk more about classic relationships

549
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
that a host can have.

550
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I think that on the contrary,

551
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
what interests us more here is really

552
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
the self-guided part,

553
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
that is, it is you who choose the server.

554
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So, in the things to know,

555
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
to be in conformity with the new

556
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
ACNIL directive,

557
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
so this conformity guide

558
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
has nothing to do with the old one

559
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
which was on the ACNIL site

560
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and which was mainly talking about

561
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
the old name of the solution,

562
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
certainly things that were already present

563
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
in the old guide, but there are new things

564
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
that came to be added.

565
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So one of these things is

566
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
the deactivation of export

567
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
features.

568
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So these export features are

569
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
relative to the little link that allows you to export

570
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
data, but also above all

571
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
it is the fact that we will no longer

572
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
have the right to use

573
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
by default the use

574
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
of the visitor's journal. This can be very annoying,

575
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
especially for analysts who do

576
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
a bit of debugging like me.

577
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You can only have this function

578
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
if you are a super user.

579
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So in my case, I am

580
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
a super user, so there is no problem.

581
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So here I am in my Tomo.

582
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If I want to respect the first

583
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
instruction that ACNIL gives me,

584
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I will have to go here in system,

585
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
click here in general settings

586
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and once I am in

587
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
general settings, click on

588
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
deactivate the visitor's journal

589
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
that I will find

590
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
here.

591
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So I will have to check

592
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
these boxes.

593
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I will first show you what the visitor's journal is

594
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
for those who do not

595
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
identify what it is.

596
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The visitor's journal is a

597
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
super great feature that allows you

598
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
to see

599
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
what actions

600
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the users perform.

601
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So you have the right

602
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
to use it by default,

603
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
if you want to be exempt from consent.

604
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I think it is rather understandable

605
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
the idea that a user who comes back

606
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
several times, who has a certain behavior,

607
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
we will be able to

608
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
identify him

609
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and potentially identify

610
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
who he is, if we have another source of information

611
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
that tells us that someone

612
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
is outside our website, for example.

613
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So to respect

614
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
the first criterion,

615
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
you will have to check here.

616
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Click on

617
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I hope it's this address.

618
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
No, it was not the right one.

619
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Sorry, I go back

620
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to where I was.

621
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I will pass my story.

622
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Registered.

623
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It must be this one.

624
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So there we are.

625
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Consequences, what will it be?

626
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It says that now that this box

627
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
is checked, Abracadabra,

628
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
the visitor's journal has disappeared.

629
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The visitor's journal has disappeared

630
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
from this screen.

631
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It is also the same

632
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
for the segmented log.

633
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So if I am going to consult an archived report

634
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and I am going to ask, for example,

635
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
here what are the users who come from Serbia,

636
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you see that the little icon of the segmented log

637
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
has disappeared.

638
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This is the first criterion.

639
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Second thing to know.

640
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Allow visitors

641
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
to refuse to be followed.

642
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
What is called Locked Out.

643
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
There is no secret about the old Matomo guide.

644
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It has always been the case.

645
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Even if you are exempt from consent,

646
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
you have to offer

647
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
a mechanism of opposition

648
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
to your visitor.

649
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
This is what we will find on the

650
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Privacy Policy page,

651
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
a confidentiality page for private lives.

652
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You have to provide

653
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
clear information

654
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
to your users.

655
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You have to be able to offer

656
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
a mechanism of opposition.

657
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
On this confidentiality page,

658
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
you have to explain what Matomo is,

659
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
what it is used for, what data is collected.

660
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You also have to offer the possibility

661
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
to the user, even if you collect

662
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
anonymous data on me,

663
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I don't want you to collect it and oppose it.

664
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's not hard to set it up.

665
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You just have to go here

666
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
in Matomo,

667
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
you have private life,

668
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
private life, you have users' inscriptions

669
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and there you have a small iframe

670
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
that you can copy and paste.

671
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
If you think it's not super sexy,

672
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
because after all we are talking about an iframe,

673
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
so it's always a little annoying,

674
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
but you have the possibility

675
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
to use personalized HTML.

676
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't remember

677
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
where we found it.

678
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Implement a custom without

679
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
using JavaScript.

680
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
They put a complete example

681
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
that allows you to have the script

682
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
with the look and feel of your website.

683
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's generally more aesthetic.

684
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
When we have a little time to spare,

685
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
we prefer to take this solution

686
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
rather than the iframe

687
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
directly from Matomo.

688
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Next point on our to-do list.

689
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Check that the default parameters

690
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
of Matomo are still in place.

691
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
By default, Matomo will set up

692
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the anonymization of the IP address.

693
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Here we say that

694
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
check that the default parameters

695
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
are still in place because

696
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
it is not said that you do not take the baby

697
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
to someone, so the project to someone,

698
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and that this person can have,

699
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
for X or Y reasons,

700
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
a default functioning Matomo.

701
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
At the top, you have to look

702
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that you are at least

703
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
on this level of anonymization

704
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and that you are not on someone

705
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
who has changed this box

706
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and who has recovered the entire IP address.

707
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
By default, there is little chance

708
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that it will move, but it never happens.

709
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't know, someone wanted to debunk it,

710
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
to use it more on users.

711
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Make sure that third-party cookies

712
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and cross-domain cookies are not used.

713
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
By default, Matomo uses only

714
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
the first-party cookies, so there is no need

715
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to take care of it.

716
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Normally, by default,

717
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
you should not have it.

718
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Here we reach the point

719
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
that we just mentioned.

720
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Maybe someone did some work before you

721
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and put in place the cross-domain

722
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and put in place the third-party cookie part.

723
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I will not go into too much detail.

724
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It will be about mechanics

725
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
that you will find inside

726
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
the Matomo config file,

727
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
where it will be clearly indicated here.

728
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
For that, you have to access the server,

729
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
access the config.ini.php file,

730
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
if it is not there,

731
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
well, there is no need

732
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
to torture yourself.

733
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
There is no third-party cookie

734
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
feature that has been put in place.

735
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Same thing for cross-domain tracking.

736
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This is something that we will see

737
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
directly in Matomo's follow-up code.

738
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It is a line that adds

739
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
more other things.

740
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
These are things that are rather visible,

741
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
so we can see quickly if we want to

742
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
if we are on a custom interface.

743
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Most of the time, you will not have to

744
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
check all the same,

745
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
but in most of the Matomo that we recover,

746
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
we never have things like that.

747
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Make sure that the user ID measure

748
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
is not used.

749
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
User ID, I had already mentioned it

750
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
in the introduction, which allows you to know

751
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
who the user is behind.

752
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
This will be installed when you have

753
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
internet or e-commerce sites.

754
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It is the same, it is not installed

755
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
like that by the Holy Spirit.

756
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It is that there will be a mechanic

757
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
that has been put in place.

758
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You have to imagine that you are not allowed

759
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
to collect this data.

760
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You will have to ask for the user's agreement

761
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and if you have the user's agreement,

762
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
then you can use it.

763
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
We will necessarily have to call

764
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
an integration team to

765
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
set up a consent mode

766
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
so that people can

767
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
give their agreement

768
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
to have this data collected.

769
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Point number D was a bit of a surprise.

770
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We did not expect it.

771
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It is the fact that e-commerce

772
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
cannot be used by default

773
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
without having the user's agreement.

774
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You will have to deactivate

775
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
this option as long as

776
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
you do not have the user's agreement.

777
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We are joining

778
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
what is mentioned here

779
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
for the user ID.

780
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We will have to have a pop-up

781
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
or a information banner to say

782
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
do you accept to have information

783
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
that is collected regarding

784
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
e-commerce.

785
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Point number E, same thing.

786
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It is a bit of a surprise to see it

787
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
because Matomo has premium plugins

788
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
including the heat card

789
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and the session recording

790
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
that we call

791
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
hitmap and session recording.

792
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
By default,

793
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
you have to deactivate them.

794
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I think it is an interpretation

795
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
that is too intrusive

796
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
even if it does not collect personal data.

797
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Let's know that Matomo

798
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
has already provided mechanisms

799
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
that allow you to remove

800
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
personal data when

801
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
you use them.

802
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But apparently,

803
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
by default,

804
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
you have to deactivate them

805
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
as long as you do not have the user's agreement.

806
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Point number 4 is the one

807
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
that I mentioned in the introduction.

808
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
If your site is poorly designed

809
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and you have URLs

810
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
that already collect personal data,

811
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
you will have to put them

812
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
in conformity.

813
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You modify your follow-up code

814
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
so that it does not collect

815
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
these identifiers in the URLs.

816
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
By chance, Matomo

817
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
provides a tool

818
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
that allows you to anonymize

819
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
the data of the past.

820
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
We can decide

821
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
to delete

822
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
data that is in the past,

823
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
in particular,

824
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
URLs

825
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
that would contain

826
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
personal data.

827
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I do not know

828
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
if it is exactly

829
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
the URLs that

830
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
anonymize the reference.

831
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The request parameters

832
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
on the URLs,

833
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I think

834
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
it would be necessary

835
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
to delete them.

836
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm not sure if you

837
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
can analyze

838
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
TracroData

839
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
when I look at it.

840
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You can still

841
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
question certain columns

842
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and analyze them.

843
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That was what I wanted to show you

844
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
on how to put Matomo

845
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
in conformity

846
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
with the RGPD.

847
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I see that it is already 13h42

848
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
on the diapos that I have left.

849
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I have not yet spoken

850
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
about the consent collection.

851
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
If you collect personal data,

852
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
what should you do?

853
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You have a doc

854
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
on Matomo

855
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
that is rarely used

856
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
because in the end,

857
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
people prefer to use Matomo

858
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
with the consent exemption

859
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
to collect data.

860
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You have a line of code

861
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
to add,

862
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
user for consent,

863
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
how to not track,

864
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
let user opt out.

865
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I just need to find

866
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
the URL

867
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
that I wanted.

868
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I will not be able to find it in time.

869
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Matomo consent type

870
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Matomo get consent

871
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
developer

872
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's it.

873
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
These are the lines of code

874
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that you will have to use

875
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
if you want to collect

876
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the consent of the user

877
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
to have the right to collect

878
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
personal data on Hulu.

879
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Typically, this will be the case when you

880
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
develop e-commerce tracking,

881
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
when you put the user ID in place,

882
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
etc.

883
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
As I was saying,

884
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
we are on much more advanced projects

885
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
that will be much more technical.

886
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
We will have to apply

887
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
in development.

888
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
There will be even more work

889
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
if you find

890
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
different data collection purposes.

891
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
For e-commerce tracking,

892
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
it is quite easy to justify

893
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
why you need to collect this data.

894
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
When we use the user ID,

895
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
directly tracking the user

896
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
personally,

897
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
the purposes will probably be different.

898
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
This means that you will probably have to

899
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
collect several consents,

900
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
one for each of the actions,

901
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and which will probably

902
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
be asked at different places.

903
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That was what I wanted to present to you.

904
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
We are at the end of this presentation.

905
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sorry, I overworked a little.

906
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Frédéric, I don't know if there are

907
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
any questions in the chat.

908
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
At the moment, no,

909
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
but I will invite everyone

910
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
who has questions

911
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
to ask them in the chat.

912
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I hope that

913
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I was clear with the presentation.

914
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
What you need to remember

915
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
is that in France,

916
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
it is clearly the CNIL

917
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
that we must follow.

918
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We apply it.

919
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It is a very interesting security

920
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
because the day we get

921
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
something wrong,

922
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
you can take out the guide

923
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
that I showed you earlier

924
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and say, look, I have everything

925
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
applied to the letter.

926
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Then, what you need to understand

927
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
is that for the other case,

928
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
which is the second,

929
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
which I presented at the end

930
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
of the conference,

931
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
it is a little more delicate

932
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
than the integration to do

933
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
when we will have the interactions.

934
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
There is a question

935
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
that I put in the chat.

936
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
First of all, thank you

937
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
for asking a question.

938
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's super nice

939
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and hello to you.

940
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The question is the following.

941
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I understand that with this configuration,

942
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
we cover the exempted measure

943
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
and the right to opposition.

944
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
In any case,

945
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
with this configuration,

946
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
the configuration

947
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
that I presented

948
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
also includes what I explained

949
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
in the introduction.

950
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I will not talk about the RGPD

951
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
specifically in this conference.

952
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The right to opposition is one of the

953
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
considerations in the RGPD,

954
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
but there are many others.

955
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
What I showed is just to have

956
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
the right to be exempted,

957
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
but it does not exempt you from

958
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
respecting all other rights of the RGPD,

959
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
which are the right to access information

960
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and the right to export data.

961
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It is a user who

962
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
asks for data portability,

963
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
who asks if you export the data.

964
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
There are many other aspects

965
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
that I did not mention

966
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
that are linked to the RGPD in general

967
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and to Matomo.

968
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I will talk more about the implementation

969
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
of Matomo to be exempted from consent.

970
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
The question continues.

971
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
What is the personalized classic measure

972
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
when users give their consent?

973
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
The classic measure

974
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I call it

975
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
personalized measure.

976
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
We will collect

977
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
personal data

978
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
on the users.

979
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It does not change much.

980
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
What changes is the code

981
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that you have to add

982
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
to recover their consent.

983
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It is just that it is

984
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
much more technical.

985
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
There will be two consequences.

986
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The first consequence is that

987
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
as soon as it lands on your website,

988
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
you do not recover the data.

989
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You do not have the right to recover it

990
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
until they give their consent.

991
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Now they will give their consent.

992
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
To give their consent,

993
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
you have to add specific

994
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
follow-up code.

995
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You will have to deploy efforts

996
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
to have this follow-up code

997
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
put in place.

998
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
For the rest, it does not change.

999
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
For the rest, it is like for the

1000
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
exemption process of consent.

1001
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You have data collected in Matomo.

1002
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You have the right to information.

1003
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
You have a data confidentiality page

1004
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
that explains what is Matomo,

1005
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
what it does, etc.

1006
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You have the right to opposition.

1007
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You do not have the right to portability.

1008
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You do not have the right to delete data.

1009
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
This is more the classic RGPD

1010
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
where you have to have your procedure

1011
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
which is only in case of control

1012
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
or in case of demand by a data subject,

1013
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
by an individual.

1014
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
You have to respect the procedure.

1015
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So, the question continues.

1016
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
We start another tracker

1017
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
that would contain the advanced features,

1018
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
user ID, e-commerce, etc.

1019
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
at the time of consent.

1020
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yes, that's exactly it.

1021
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That's exactly it.

1022
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You understood everything in the question.

1023
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
This is my question mark

1024
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and more behind on

1025
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
is your follow-up code

1026
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
there you have the right to

1027
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
trigger everything at once.

1028
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
In fact, it depends especially on what you put

1029
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
in the information bannier.

1030
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
In fact, the RGPD says that

1031
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
you have to provide clear and precise information.

1032
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So, you can not say

1033
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
in a global way

1034
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
that you authorize me to collect everything on you.

1035
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
In fact, your user ID has a purpose.

1036
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Your follow-up e-commerce has a purpose.

1037
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Your personalized dimensions

1038
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
probably have another purpose.

1039
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Maybe the purpose is the same

1040
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
but there is nothing that says it.

1041
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Anyway, it's up to you

1042
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
to ask yourself the question,

1043
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
with a third of what they think.

1044
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And from there,

1045
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
to decide to make a global message

1046
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
and the person gives you his authorization

1047
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and you send everything at once.

1048
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Or is it better to divide them?

1049
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
As the RGPD says,

1050
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
it's always good sense

1051
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and analysis.

1052
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
For me, e-commerce clearly has

1053
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
a purpose that is very different

1054
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
from that of user ID.

1055
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
For me, the purpose is to improve the business number

1056
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
of your company.

1057
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And with user ID,

1058
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
you are clearly on a functionality

1059
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that is much more intrusive.

1060
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Follow the user in a certain way

1061
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
to know what's going on.

1062
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Then you can always justify it

1063
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
in another way by saying

1064
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I don't use user ID,

1065
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I use user ID as a pseudonym

1066
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
so I don't necessarily want to know

1067
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
who is the person behind it.

1068
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
All this is discussed and analyzed.

1069
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I also invite you to ask

1070
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
all the other people

1071
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
present at MatomoCamp

1072
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
who are doing contests

1073
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
around privacy

1074
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
because they may have a vision

1075
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
that is completely different

1076
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
from the one I present.

1077
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
In any case, it's the one I have at first

1078
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
when I read the questions

1079
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and the answers that come to mind.

1080
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I have another question

1081
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
from Abdel

1082
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
that I also greet

1083
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
and thank you for asking this question.

1084
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
You mentioned that e-commerce

1085
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
follows consent.

1086
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I was surprised to see it

1087
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and that in the new guide

1088
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
of the CNIL,

1089
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
it's not me who says it directly,

1090
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
it's just that it's written

1091
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
directly in the CNIL.

1092
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I would have preferred it not to be the case,

1093
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
but they wrote it.

1094
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
The CNIL therefore considers

1095
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
that it is a personal data.

1096
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
In any case, the CNIL considers

1097
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
that it is necessary to have

1098
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
the consent of the user

1099
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
of the e-commerce follow-up code.

1100
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
When we think about

1101
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
what's behind it,

1102
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
when we visualize the Matomo code,

1103
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
what do we need the Matomo code

1104
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
to trigger?

1105
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We keep in the Matomo doc

1106
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
on the e-commerce follow-up

1107
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and in the e-commerce follow-up,

1108
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
one of the information it needs is

1109
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
the e-commerce order ID,

1110
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
the order number.

1111
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It is clear that in the database

1112
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and you know that

1113
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
it is Abdelte

1114
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
who bought

1115
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
such a pair of shoes,

1116
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
it is by definition

1117
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
a personal data.

1118
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It is in the scope

1119
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that we need

1120
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
the consent of the user

1121
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
to collect this personal data.

1122
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Even if the order is not linked

1123
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
to a specific ID,

1124
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
do you think it can evolve?

1125
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I also think that

1126
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
it is a good question

1127
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
that you ask

1128
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and I was a little surprised

1129
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
by the fact that it was in the guide

1130
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
because when you look

1131
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
at what Matomo says,

1132
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
in any case in the features

1133
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
that Matomo offers,

1134
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
you have this possibility.

1135
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Frédéric, do you see my screen well?

1136
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yes, I see it.

1137
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
What we have here is

1138
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
anonymizing the order ID.

1139
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
We have it here in Matomo

1140
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and generally

1141
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
in private life,

1142
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
we identify well

1143
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
the notion of pseudonym

1144
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
which is still a personal data

1145
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
of anonymization which is not a personal data.

1146
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I am quite surprised

1147
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that this functionality

1148
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
would not have been

1149
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
retained by Acne

1150
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
and the fact that

1151
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
there is no

1152
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
that in the end

1153
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Acne considers

1154
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
that it is not enough.

1155
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think that in my opinion,

1156
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the question to be asked,

1157
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
we saw it in four days

1158
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
to have an answer for an answer

1159
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
that falls aside,

1160
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I think that what is more interesting

1161
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
is to contact the Matomo team directly.

1162
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I found something

1163
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
that was quite great

1164
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
in the Matomo team doc

1165
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
on the RGPD part.

1166
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Fred, excuse me,

1167
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
do you still see my screen?

1168
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yes, I confirm.

1169
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Basically, when we are in charge of the RGPD

1170
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
and we are a company,

1171
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
we are obliged

1172
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
to have a DPO

1173
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and the Matomo team has a DPO.

1174
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I think that your question is very interesting

1175
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
and that we will have to request

1176
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
the DPO of the Matomo team.

1177
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
They have an EU representative

1178
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
who is

1179
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think his name is Christian

1180
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
no, Christophe, Christophe Boer.

1181
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
They really have

1182
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
a dedicated person

1183
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
who is there to answer this type of question.

1184
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I think it can be

1185
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
really the subject of a great question.

1186
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Thank you for asking me.

1187
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
To write to him and say

1188
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
you write to privacyatmatomo.org

1189
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and he says hello, hello Christophe.

1190
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I do not understand.

1191
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Normally, if we anonymize

1192
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
the thing, we should

1193
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
and the idea is to see

1194
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
what is behind it.

1195
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Honestly, I think that legally,

1196
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
you do not risk much

1197
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
because you can clearly show a blank page

1198
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and say, look, it's anonymized,

1199
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
it's not pseudonymized,

1200
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
but it's still better to have

1201
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
an answer from someone

1202
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
who has more of a legal background.

1203
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So that's why, in my opinion,

1204
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I think it's maybe the reflex to have.

1205
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
After the question, why didn't I do it?

1206
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Because I don't have time,

1207
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I just have to do it.

1208
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah, great.

1209
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Well, listen, I'm going to take

1210
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
the last question and then

1211
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
after, I'll have two minutes

1212
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
to breathe and do the last one.

1213
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
A question from Adama.

1214
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Will Matomo not become paying in the future?

1215
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
No, because by definition,

1216
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Matomo is a free software

1217
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
that lives thanks to the confidence

1218
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
that the community has given him.

1219
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So anyway, they, next to Matomo,

1220
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
they already have their business model in place,

1221
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
which is cloud, which works well,

1222
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
which are the premium features

1223
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
which also work well.

1224
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You have to imagine that from the moment

1225
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
when you have a stab in your community,

1226
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
which would be, finally, guys,

1227
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
now we're making a paid software,

1228
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
there you lose your value proposal,

1229
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
well, you basically lose

1230
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
the added value of everything

1231
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
that has been renamed.

1232
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Anyway, we see it.

1233
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
There is a pack of competitors

1234
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
that we also tried to present

1235
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
as an alternative to Matomo

1236
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
by saying, hey, we have a free software.

1237
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Well, from the moment they have a minimum

1238
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
of popularity, what did they do?

1239
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
They said, well, finally, we have a proprietary software.

1240
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
We close our source code and become paying.

1241
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So what's going on?

1242
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Their software fell into oblivion

1243
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
because they killed their added value.

1244
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So in any case, I'm not

1245
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
one who's on it.

1246
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And then I also think that

1247
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
they have already proven it in the past.

1248
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
In particular,

1249
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
if you look historically,

1250
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
it's a story around P-Week Pro

1251
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
and formerly P-Week.

1252
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It is precisely in this spirit

1253
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
that everything has been,

1254
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
that I think Matomo has already proved

1255
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
that they are a free software,

1256
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
they remain since the people behind

1257
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
in this life.

1258
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It is currently 13h57.

1259
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I thank you very much to all of you for having

1260
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
attended this conference.

1261
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And then I'll see you in three minutes for a new conference

1262
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
on how to develop a whole business with Matomo

1263
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
which will be a conference in English.

1264
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Thank you to Frédéric for moderating this conference.

1265
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:23,000
See you soon.
