1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,940
Hi there, everybody. How are you? I hope you're doing well. So my name is Boris, and today

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:21,320
we're going to go over how we can have our own Matomo instance. I'm sure we have heard

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,260
a lot of positive things about it during MatomoCamp. And so I wanted to host a workshop on how

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,960
everyone can install their own Matomo instance. Now, when we want to have a Matomo instance

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,600
up and running, the first thing we will need will be to have a computer to run it. So we'll

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,060
also go over where you can find different providers, and I'll try to make it as easy

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:59,040
to follow. But in case anybody has questions during the workshop, please feel free to write

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,220
in the chat, and I'll do my best to explain everything to you.

9
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:12,240
So before we dive into Matomo, first I would like to introduce myself. So as I mentioned,

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,680
my name is Boris. I am based in Albania, which is located in Europe, and I have been contributing

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,360
to different open source projects for around six years now. I am a member of the local

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:38,200
hackerspace, open the apps hackerspace, and I also am part of cloud68.co, where what we

13
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,960
do is we maintain different open source instances like Matomo, for example, where we not only

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,840
install them, but we make sure there are backups, monitoring for the health of the service,

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,680
and provide support. So I think that's a pretty good beginning introduction about myself.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,720
So without further ado, I would like to get into how you can have your own Matomo instance.

17
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:15,640
So for the guide, I have estimated that our Matomo instance should be able to handle around

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:24,560
100,000 visits, and that is based off the official documentation from the Matomo website.

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,840
Of course, as you scale up, you might need a different setup to accommodate for all the

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,480
traffic that you're going to be having. So as I was mentioning, the first thing we're

21
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,920
going to need is a computer, or more specifically, what we need is a server. That way, when somebody

22
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,840
goes to the URL for our Matomo site, they will be able to see the website. And there

23
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,960
are a couple of different providers. One of the first things you need to keep in mind

24
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:02,280
is, if you're doing a setup similar to what we're going to do, you need to be aware of

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,400
where most of your user visits are going to be from, because the closer the server is

26
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,400
to your users, the faster it will load. If I am in Europe and I try to access a server,

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,480
for example, in Asia, it might be much slower to load compared to a server that's in Germany.

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:31,480
So one of the providers I highly recommend usually is Hetzner. They offer dedicated servers,

29
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,120
but they also offer virtual private servers. And the difference in that explained very

30
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,840
briefly is that with a VPS or a virtual private server, you essentially get a small chunk

31
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,280
of a physical machine. And you can install whatever you want on it. It has its own operating

32
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,880
system, and it's quite easy to add more hardware to it. Whereas compared with a dedicated server,

33
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,800
you have a lot more hardware and computing power allocated to it, but it does require

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,040
more maintenance because you have to look out for stuff like hard drive failures or

35
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,000
RAM corruption, and you have to constantly monitor it. So in Hetzner, the virtual private

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,560
server section, they call it Hetzner Cloud, and they have pretty good beginning prices.

37
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,920
So for a Matomo instance of about 100,000 users, something like the CX11 tier, which

38
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,900
has one CPU core and two gigabytes of RAM is a good start. And if you essentially use

39
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,620
all of that computing power, you can just upgrade to the next plan and downgrade later

40
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:56,380
on down the line. Another popular provider is DigitalOcean. The good thing about DigitalOcean

41
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:04,080
is that it has a lot more data centers compared to Hetzner. So Hetzner only has data centers

42
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,760
in Europe. And yesterday or the day before that, they launched a new data center in the

43
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:20,140
US, but DigitalOcean has data centers in a couple of US cities in Europe, as well as

44
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:27,320
in Asia. So if you're outside of Europe, I will highly recommend checking out DigitalOcean.

45
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,420
Another popular provider is also Linode, which is fairly similar to DigitalOcean. You can

46
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,880
of course use Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. I personally don't use them

47
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:50,280
because I don't agree with essentially their ethics. Google, Amazon, and other big tech

48
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,600
companies have been known to not be the most privacy respecting companies out there. So

49
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,500
I try to stay away from them, but of course you are free to host them wherever you want.

50
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:11,640
Okay, so in preparation for today's workshop, I have already created a server on Hetzner.

51
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:21,000
And the domain for that, I am going to paste it in the chat really quickly, will be matamotest.cloud68.co.

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,600
If you go to that URL, you will not see anything load. And that's because nothing has been

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:36,840
set up yet. So give me a bit of time to share my screen. And I think you should be able

54
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,280
to see it now. Let me just make it a bit bigger so that you can see. If the screen size, the

55
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:51,120
font size is too small, please let me know and I'll increase it. Okay, so first thing

56
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,840
you are going to want to do is to connect to that server. And for that, we use SSH.

57
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,580
So this is a command that lets you connect to the server as root, which is a user that

58
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,780
can perform, can execute all the commands on the server, which will be very helpful

59
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:20,240
during installation, but it's usually recommended to not run commands as root. So now we are

60
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,120
inside the server. And you can see that because here it says root at matamotest, whereas before

61
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:37,120
it was saying Boris at whatever my computer name is. Okay, first thing you do after connecting

62
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,960
to a new server will be to make sure that it's up to date with the latest version because

63
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,500
packages come out all the time. So new software comes out all the time. And since this computer

64
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,360
will be publicly accessed, we want to make sure it's up to date so that it's more secure.

65
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,960
So this is running Ubuntu 18. And to update the packages, we have to run two commands.

66
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,720
The first one will be apt update. And this essentially just refreshes the list of new

67
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,160
software, but it doesn't actually install them. So if we let it finish real quick, there

68
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,640
we go. It says that three packages can be upgraded. And to upgrade them, what we have

69
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:32,680
to do is we will have to run apt upgrade in this case. So let's just confirm that we indeed

70
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:46,640
want to update. Okay, there we go. So now what we have to do is we are going to have

71
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,520
to install some other software to make sure that, you know, if you go to that URL that

72
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,320
I shared in the chat, Matomo shows up and your browser knows how to interact with this

73
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:06,640
computer. So the different components that we need installed are mainly a web server,

74
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,840
which is a program installed on the server so that your browser knows how to talk to

75
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:19,400
it. We'll need a database. So this is where Matomo will store all the data that it collects.

76
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,600
And for this guide, we will be using something called MySQL. Of course, you are free to use

77
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,680
whatever you want, as long as the program is compatible with it. And the last thing

78
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:39,080
we're going to need to install will be the PHP softwares into the server. So Matomo is

79
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,200
written in PHP. And for that reason, we need to make sure that the server itself can run

80
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:54,360
this program and then serve that on your browser. Okay, so to install the web server, it's really,

81
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,800
really easy. Using the apt command from before, we're going to tell it to install, and then

82
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,760
we're going to say the name of the program that we want to install. In the case of the

83
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,240
web server, we're going to be using something called Nginx. Another very popular option

84
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,040
is Apache 2. But there are a couple more you might want to dive into at your own leisure.

85
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,560
And other than Nginx, we are also going to install MySQL server. So this is the web server,

86
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:35,480
and this is the database server. Let's just run that really quickly.

87
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:43,120
Now when it comes to PHP installation, you can use different versions of PHP. Matomo

88
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:53,600
itself recommends using PHP 7.2 or up. For this guide, we'll be using PHP 7.4. So the

89
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:04,360
problem then becomes that PHP 7.4 is not available by default, I think, in Ubuntu 18.04. So we

90
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:12,220
have to add something called a repository, which is like a list of other packages or

91
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:19,560
other programs that you can install on your computer that are not available by default.

92
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:27,240
So to do that, what we first have to run is this command, which installs some, it's essentially

93
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,480
the apt command again, but it installs some background applications needed to follow the

94
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,360
other steps. And we can see in this case, because it didn't say installing anything

95
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:49,080
new, it was already present in my installation. Okay. Now we are going to run another command,

96
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,000
which is add apt repository. So essentially add a new list of possible programs that you

97
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,320
can install. And then the repository that we're going to be installing is Andre slash

98
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:11,400
PHP. So if we press enter on that, it will warn us with things that we need to keep in

99
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:18,920
mind of, and then it will ask us to press enter to continue. So we're going to do that.

100
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,440
And here you can see that it's updating the list of programs. So these are what it had

101
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:35,520
by default. And then you can see here what we just added. Okay. Now we can run the step

102
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:44,480
to install PHP 7.4. So let's go ahead and do that. I am going to be installing a version

103
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:58,680
of PHP 7.4 called FPM. So let's press enter on that. And let's just give it a little bit

104
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:10,320
of time to configure everything. Okay. So now we are pretty much almost ready to continue

105
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:19,240
with a Matomo installation, but PHP in Ubuntu 18 comes with what are called modules. So

106
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:26,880
these are optional softwares that you install on your computer and they provide more functions

107
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:35,000
to PHP. If you head over to the Matomo user installation guide, so let me get that link

108
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,960
and paste it in the chat really quickly. So in here you will see that the recommendation

109
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:51,640
is to install a bunch of packages. I have written them down beforehand. And what we're

110
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,400
going to do is we're going to install them, but we want to make sure that we install the

111
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:05,720
same version for the module as we did for PHP when we initially installed it here. So

112
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:13,640
I said 7.4 and I have to make sure that in here it also says 7.4. So let's go ahead and

113
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:30,800
press enter on that. And let's give it a bit of time. There we go. Now we are ready to

114
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:42,480
download the Matomo code from Matomo's website. So let me reshare my screen really quickly.

115
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:54,360
I think it's this one. Yeah. Okay. So let's open that in fuller view. What we're going

116
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,840
to want to do is we're going to want to go to the download Matomo section and we can

117
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:07,440
see that the latest release is version 4.5.0. And we're going to want to right click this

118
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,920
button over here. And we're going to want to copy the link. Now let's jump back into

119
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:28,760
the server. So let me share my screen one more time. Okay. And let's make it a bit easier

120
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:35,760
to read by removing all of these things. If you also want to clear screen in case you're

121
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,040
following along, you can type clear. And once you press enter, it will essentially free

122
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,680
up your view so that it's easier to read what's going on. Okay. First we're going to want

123
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,720
to download the URL we just copied. So to do that in Ubuntu, you can use curl or you

124
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:02,120
can use something called wget. I personally prefer wget. So let's go with that. And the

125
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,600
syntax for that will be wget and the URL that we just copied. So once we press enter, we

126
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,680
can see that it has downloaded it. We can verify this by running another command called

127
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:24,520
ls, which is something like list structure. And we can see here that matomo.zip does indeed

128
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:32,860
exist in my current directory. So you can see that it's a.zip file. So it's an archive

129
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,920
and it has a bunch of folders inside. What we're going to want to do is we're going to

130
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:46,880
want to unpack that. So first let's create a directory called matomo. To create a directory,

131
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,760
I use the command called mkdir, then a space, and then the name of the directory I want

132
00:16:52,760 --> 00:17:00,920
to create. Then we're going to type mv, which moves a file or a folder to another location.

133
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:10,200
And we're going to move matomo.zip to the matomo folder. So if you run ls one more time,

134
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,120
we can see that now we have this folder. And inside that folder, we have the zip file that

135
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:24,200
we downloaded. Okay. Then we are going to want to enter that folder and all the commands

136
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,400
that we're going to be executing now will take place from there. So to change the directory,

137
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,520
you have to use a command called cd. And then after the space, you enter the directory that

138
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:44,360
you want to go in. So in that case, cd matomo. And we are going to want to unzip this. So

139
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:51,560
we say unzip and then the file name matomo.zip. And we can see it's printing out a bunch of

140
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:59,040
stuff. So if we run ls, we will see there is a how to install matomo.html. There is

141
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:07,160
a matomo folder and then there is the matomo.zip file that we downloaded. Now for the next

142
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:13,080
step, what we're going to want to do is we are going to want to move this matomo folder

143
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,120
that we just extracted. And we're going to want to move that to a place where our web

144
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,600
server, so in a place where the program in our computer, which makes sure that the site

145
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,840
loads from the browser, has the option of reading those files. So to do that, let's

146
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:41,960
use the mv command again and say matomo. And the place where we want to move this in Ubuntu

147
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:51,600
is slash bar slash www. So this is a default directory that is created when we install

148
00:18:51,600 --> 00:19:00,880
our web server. So if we go over there now, we will see that we have HTML and matomo.

149
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:12,720
And if we go to, let me share my screen again. But essentially, if we go to our URL, so that

150
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,360
is matomotest.cloud6a.co, we will see a welcome to nginx page, which to me doesn't look a

151
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,900
lot like the software we want to install. But the good thing is we can change that.

152
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:35,800
So to do that, let's jump back into our terminal window, where we are typing the commands.

153
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,600
And first, if we run ls, so the same command to show the structure, but this time we add

154
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:53,400
a dash l, it will show us a bit more information on the contents of the slash bar slash www

155
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,440
folder. And what we're going to want to do is that for the matomo user, currently its

156
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,480
owner is the root user, which is the user I am logged in as, but it's generally recommended

157
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:15,360
that you change the permissions of this folder. So to change the permission, or more exactly

158
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:24,560
to change the owner, we have to type chown, and then we're going to type a option which

159
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:33,040
says don't change the owner of just this folder, but change the owner of all folders and files

160
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:41,960
inside this folder. So that is dash r, capital R. And then we define the user that we are

161
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,880
going to grant ownership of this folder to. So in the case of nginx on ubuntu, this user

162
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:59,560
is called www dash data. And then we have to do the same thing, but this time what we're

163
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:07,800
defining here is the group. So we essentially set an owner, which is a user on our system

164
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,560
and a group that have ownership to this folder. So let's go ahead and complete the command

165
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,120
by specifying the directory that we want, which is matomo, and press enter. Now for

166
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,360
the next step, we're going to want to change the configuration of our web server. So to

167
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,460
do that, we are going to be using a text editor. I'm sure a lot of people have strong opinions

168
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:41,680
about which text editor you should use. In my opinion, you should just use a text editor

169
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:49,320
that you know how to use and can easily navigate around. So in my case, I use nano and the

170
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,640
file we are going to want to edit is located inside the etc folder, which is where most

171
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,360
of the configuration for different softwares is located in Linux. And we're going to say

172
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,120
nginx and we can see that there are a bunch of files and folders here, but the one we're

173
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,560
interested in is sites enabled. So let's go ahead and type that. And in here we can see

174
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:27,120
that there is a file called default. So let's go ahead and change that. I will mute just

175
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:50,240
for a minute for the ambulance to drive by. Okay, now it must be a bit easier to hear.

176
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,920
So I'm going to cheat a little bit. I'm going to be using an nginx template, which I had

177
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:07,520
already prepared beforehand, but you can find pretty much the same configuration online.

178
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,240
And I'm going to want to change a couple of things. So before I change them, let me first

179
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:21,360
explain what we're doing. When you visit a website and you go to HTTP, what essentially

180
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:28,340
you say is, hey, I want to access this server, but think of the server as a building. Sure,

181
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:34,320
you might want to enter a building, but you have to choose a door in which you enter from.

182
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:41,160
And in computers, we use port to describe this behavior. So you want to specify a port

183
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:51,000
for that. Luckily for us or unluckily, depends on how you look at it, some ports are standards.

184
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:01,400
So for HTTP, we use port 80. And for HTTPS, so that's when the site has a green lock next

185
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:11,080
to it and says that the site is secure. We use port 443. We're not quite ready for port

186
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:18,680
443. So let's change the configuration a bit by essentially commenting out some of these

187
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:26,720
functions, but we can uncomment them later. To comment them, we just use this icon in front

188
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:35,320
of what we want to comment. So let's go ahead and do that for a few lines here. What we're

189
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:44,200
doing mostly is we're removing the SSL configuration. So we're removing the HTTPS config. Now this

190
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,160
is not permanent because it's highly recommended that you do run HTTPS on your site because

191
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:59,000
you don't only protect your own systems, but most importantly, you protect your users.

192
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,680
And then we're going to want to change this option right here. It's actually located in

193
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:14,160
two different places called inventory hostname. This is a template for the automating tool

194
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,600
that we use at cloud68. But what we're going to want to type instead of that will be the

195
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:32,840
URL for our website. So let's say matomotest.cloud68.co and confirm everything. Okay. Another thing

196
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,360
we are going to want to have to change is the PHP version because this template uses

197
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:46,640
version 7.2 of PHP, which you can see here, whereas we installed PHP 4. So let's make

198
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:55,880
that change as well. And we are now essentially ready to save the file. So in nano to save

199
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:07,040
a file, you are going to... Yeah, I did comment the server section. So in nginx, the way you

200
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:13,120
define things is you define server blocks and in there you enter your configuration.

201
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,480
As you can see here, we have two server blocks. And the reason for that is we have one that

202
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,840
listens on port 80 and all it does, it just redirects you to HTTPS. And we have another

203
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:36,560
one for HTTPS. Now I haven't commented this section here, and that is so that we are essentially

204
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,440
just using a single server running on port 80, which will be serving the Matomo website.

205
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:55,080
But we are going to uncomment that later on. So let's go ahead and save by typing control

206
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,800
and then O. It will ask us where to save. Let's just say the default file we opened.

207
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,080
And then we're going to want to close the editor. So for that, we type control and then

208
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:16,240
X. Now we can go ahead and restart our web server, but it's usually recommended we test

209
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,000
if the syntax for what we just did is correct. So to do that, we are going to type nginx

210
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and then space dash T. This tells nginx, hey, can you test my current configuration and

211
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,720
make sure I haven't forgotten semicolon somewhere or forgotten to close a server block. So we

212
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:46,840
can see that the configuration file is syntax is okay. And we are now ready to restart our

213
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:56,320
program. To do this in Ubuntu, Ubuntu uses a system called systemd. So to restart our

214
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,480
web server application without restarting our entire server, which is a bit ineffective,

215
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:11,360
we have to type systemctl, then the operation that we want to perform. So in this case,

216
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,400
restart and then the name of the program we want to restart. So there we go. And if we

217
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:33,080
refresh our site now, let me just change my screen. We now see a new page, which is the

218
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:39,000
Matomo installation wizard. And this page, in my opinion, is really, really cool because

219
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,240
first thing it does is it performs a system check and it sees if what you have is all

220
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,280
correct and if there is anything you need to change. So we can see the PHP version is

221
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,800
fine. All of these extensions and configurations are fine. And then there are some optional

222
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:06,360
suggestions. So you can see force SSL connection. We're not using SSL and that's a problem.

223
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,960
It also gives us a bunch of information. Now I do want to continue to the next step, which

224
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,760
is database setup. But when we go to database setup, we can see that we are going to have

225
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:26,240
to enter a username, a password, a name for our database. So it's probably good to configure

226
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:36,480
HTTPS before we move on. Okay. Now to configure HTTPS, you usually have to have something

227
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,440
called an SSL certificate. And SSL certificates, there are a couple of different ways to get

228
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,440
them. You can buy one, which lasts for a year, or you can use Let's Encrypt. Let me mute

229
00:29:48,440 --> 00:30:03,600
really quickly just for the ambulance to go by. So as I was saying, you can also use something

230
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,120
called Let's Encrypt, which gives you a free certificate available for 90 days. So we're

231
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:20,120
going to say that our website is running nginx, and we're going to use upuntu 18.04. It will

232
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,400
show us some commands that we can run. And those commands first, we have to install something

233
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:36,240
called snapd, which allows us to install other packets not available by APT. And let me just

234
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,920
copy this command beforehand. This command essentially refreshes the list of available

235
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:54,720
programs for snapd to install. It's very similar to APT update that we performed. And then

236
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,900
we're going to run snap install certbot. So this is a program developed by the Electronic

237
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:08,400
Frontier Foundation, which essentially makes it very, very easy for you to get a Let's

238
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Encrypt certificate and authenticate yourself and then be able to use it. Last thing we're

239
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,240
going to do is run this command, which I can't go into details about what it does due to

240
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,080
time constraint, but it makes it possible for us to run certbot in our system and for

241
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:36,200
it to respond to us. So let's cancel this. To get the SSL certificate, we're going to

242
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:44,080
run certbot cert only. So only give us a certificate, don't do anything else to our system, and

243
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,840
then dash dash nginx, which is the web server we have installed. We are going to want to

244
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:58,000
type a email address to get security notices and renewal info. For now, let's just use

245
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,800
no reply at cloud68.co. You need to agree to their terms of service. And if you want,

246
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,760
you can sign up for their newsletter. After you do all that, it will ask you what names

247
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,560
you will want the certificate for. So it has already gotten Matomo test from our nginx

248
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:26,320
configuration. So let's just press enter. And certbot will do everything that's needed

249
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,480
for us. We won't have to take care of verifying who we are and verifying that we have access

250
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:41,720
to this domain when we own it. So now we can head back to our nginx configuration and uncomment

251
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:49,400
everything that we had commented. So in here, we define the location for our certificate.

252
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:57,320
And these are some other configuration options just to increase general security on the site.

253
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:06,040
So let's go ahead and save. We run nginx dash t again to verify everything is running correctly.

254
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:15,120
And we restart our web server again. Now, if we go back to our site, let me close my

255
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:23,820
screen share so I can show you my browser. We can see that now this website is running

256
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:32,220
on HTTPS. And we are now ready to do our database configuration. So to do our database configuration,

257
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,600
we are going to have to talk to our database server, which is installed in the same server

258
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:48,560
that we were using. Let's go there. And let me share this. Okay. So we're going to want

259
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:55,560
to type MySQL to talk to the server. And we can see that the view has changed a bit. First,

260
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,920
we're going to say create database Matomo. You can name this anything you want. Then

261
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:09,360
we're going to say create user Matomo user at localhost. So create that user in this

262
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:18,520
system identified by, I might be confusing it a bit with another syntax or another database

263
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:25,440
server. But let's use a really, really bad password for now. And next, we're going to

264
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:34,360
run grant all privileges on Matomo. So grant all accesses to the Matomo database to the

265
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:42,760
Matomo user at localhost. Okay. So everything's done now. We can now close that and go back

266
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:54,280
to the webpage we were viewing before. And for logging, we're going to say Matomo user

267
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,760
for the password, the password redefined and the database name. And we're going to click

268
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:09,580
on next. There we go. So Matomo has successfully talked to the database and created the structure

269
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:17,880
needed for us to continue. Now we create a super user. So this is our username for the

270
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:27,920
administrative account. Let me generate a quick password for this. There we go. And

271
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:38,800
we're going to want to type our email address and we can click on the configurations options

272
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:47,800
that we want and click next. And we can see that database access denied. So what I'm

273
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,440
assuming is happening here is somebody might have done this configuration before we have.

274
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:21,880
So let's go ahead and check the logs really quickly. And just give me a little bit.

275
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:33,000
Oh, I can see that my screen share is not working. Let me check really quickly what's

276
00:36:33,000 --> 00:37:02,120
going on. Give me just a second. Okay. So I just redid the configuration again. Apologies

277
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:08,160
for not seeing, but I was essentially just going over the website again. And now we can

278
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,640
set up a website that we want to monitor. So let's say cloud68.co, which is located

279
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:27,760
at this URL. We select a time zone for our website. So let's try to find Tirana or we

280
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:36,640
can just say UTC plus one. And we click on next. And it will now give us the Matomo JavaScript

281
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,760
code, which we can add to our website and start having analytics. And that is pretty

282
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:49,240
much it. We now have a beginning installation of Matomo. There are a couple of things we

283
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:58,000
can further do. We can add a geo database that will show us, you know, we can see that

284
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,320
there is a database upgrade required. So to do that, let's copy this command and run that

285
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:19,880
on our server. And I can see that you're not seeing my terminal. So let's change that.

286
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:29,120
There we go. Now, it's generally a bad idea to do this without backups, but this is a

287
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:36,240
test instance. So I guess you only live once in this case. But please don't just execute

288
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:44,200
commands on a production system without making sure you have good backups. And let's fix

289
00:38:44,200 --> 00:39:02,600
the permission. And let's upgrade Matomo. Let me change my screen again. And in here

290
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:20,480
we say admin. Let me take my password again. And there you go. You now have a Matomo instance

291
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,320
running. As I was saying, there are more things to configure your instance. You have to set

292
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,000
up automatic backups. You have to set up monitoring to make sure the instance is healthy. You

293
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:40,840
do have to set up something called cron jobs, which are essentially background jobs that

294
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,360
perform different operations on the data and make sure that your instance loads quicker

295
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,920
because it doesn't have to compute everything at the same time. It can just show you the

296
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:59,800
data it has processed ahead of time. I want to show you a few configurations really quickly

297
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,960
that are just to optimize the instance. If we have time, if not, please feel free to

298
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:15,400
stop me. But essentially we can see here that it says we should set force SSL to one in

299
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:22,200
the general section of our configuration of Matomo. And we need to increase the max allowed

300
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:30,400
packet in our SQL database to at least 64 megabytes. So there are different configuration

301
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:38,800
and tweaks that you can do to your instance to make it behave more responsive. So in case

302
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,600
there are any questions, please feel free to let me know. Now's the time and I'll look

303
00:40:46,600 --> 00:41:07,400
forward to answering them. So Melanie asks how often should the archive cron job be scheduled

304
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:17,600
for? Every hour or something else? It really depends on how much data you have really.

305
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:25,400
Usually I set a configuration where it runs once every day, but this is for installations

306
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:33,360
that track a hundred visits a day max. You can set this to run more often. Something

307
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,600
like an hour might be a good idea if the traffic you're getting is around a hundred thousand

308
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:46,920
visits, because that's essentially going to process all the data. And when Matomo has

309
00:41:46,920 --> 00:42:06,920
to calculate all of that, when you load the page, it's quite intensive for it. No problem.

310
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:31,120
Marianne, sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name, asks any reason for using nginx? To

311
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:39,820
be honest, there's no strong reason why you should use nginx or apache 2 in my opinion.

312
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,880
They are optimized for different loads. Yes. But the main criteria you have to keep in

313
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:52,000
mind is you have to use a software that you're comfortable for. In my case, I really like

314
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,640
nginx syntax. It's really easy for me to read. So that's what I use, but you can use any

315
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,520
web server there is on the planet as long as you can configure it to run. And it seems

316
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:14,800
like my pronunciation was correct. So yay. Lukas is sharing in the chat, if you are using

317
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,960
nginx, you might want to look into this link, which is a GitHub repository. Let me open

318
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:38,160
that with screen share so we can take a look at it together. There we go. Lukas, thank

319
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:47,720
you for sharing this. I did not share it beforehand. So we can see that the Matomo organization

320
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:55,760
on GitHub has a nginx configuration for Matomo. So I will highly recommend checking this out

321
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,640
to have essentially the same configuration that I copied over from our template. You

322
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:09,680
can find that one in here. And this is frequently updated. So you might want to check into it

323
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:29,080
when there are new versions of Matomo coming out. Awesome.

324
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:47,960
Okay. So Lukas is sharing that the reason is that the HD access files, so these are

325
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:55,600
some files that configure a part of how the web server operates, and they're usually used

326
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:03,080
when you use Apache 2. Lukas points out that these files won't work in nginx, which is

327
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:11,960
correct because it's an Apache 2 only setup. So those configurations won't work in nginx.

328
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:19,760
And they have had to write the config rules manually. And it's very, very important for

329
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,460
you to copy the correct config because otherwise your Matomo instance might not be protected.

330
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:33,560
Some files in the Matomo instance might not be protected. And that's not a very good idea

331
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:48,200
if your Matomo installation is public. So if I share my screen again, one such configuration,

332
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:56,160
for example, is this one. And it says, disable access to the following directories, config,

333
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:04,440
KMP, core, and length. And it says, deny all requests to these locations and show a 403

334
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:12,800
error code. Yeah, I think you should really use this config because if somebody can access

335
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:22,280
your configuration folder remotely, then it's pretty much game over. So you want to protect

336
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:37,640
that. Is there any other question that you want answered? Of course, you can ask me at

337
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:45,400
any time even later on. My username almost everywhere is this one. I am also in the metrics

338
00:46:45,400 --> 00:47:02,520
chat where you can find me with this username instead. Awesome. It looks like we have answered

339
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:09,960
all questions. So thank you again, everyone, for joining. And I hope you have fun during

340
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,520
MatomoCamp. And we'll see you around.
