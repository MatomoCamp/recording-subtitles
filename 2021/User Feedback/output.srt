1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,480
So, hello everyone, thank you for joining this second day of the MatomoCamp.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:20,440
We are very excited to start this second day with a session from Thomas Pearson, who is

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,000
a business developer at Digitalist Sweden.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,360
Thomas has worked with tracking digital analytics since 2010 and has been a contributor to open

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,040
source since 2007.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,840
In this talk, Introduction to the Matomo User Feedback Plugin, he will demo the functionality

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,920
of this form builder plugin in Matomo.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,920
So I'm giving the word to you now, Thomas.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,640
Okay, thank you very much.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm just going to wait a few seconds because I see that people have problems with the stream

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,280
now and it seems to work better now.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,520
All right, so thanks for the introduction.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, so this has been my pet for about a year or actually longer than that, but it's been

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,280
something I've been working on weekends and evenings as you know, you do when you have

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
some passion.

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,000
But today I'll be really happy to present it to a larger audience.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,600
So as you see, this is a plugin for Matomo and we'll get to the demo part pretty soon.

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,560
I got a slight introduction, but I'm Thomas, I'm a generalist when it comes to the web.

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,240
I've been programming, I've been project manager and today I'm more of a business developer

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:59,840
but I still actually do programming and I love Matomo, has been part of my life 24-7

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
for the last four years almost.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,960
So I'm starting to learn Matomo pretty well these days.

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,080
I work for Digitalist, we're a digital product agency and we really love open source.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,720
We've been contributing to open source for a really long time and we will continue doing

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,680
so and Matomo is where I work today, but my background has been within the Drupal community.

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:36,880
I started contributing to Drupal in different ways around 2005, 2006, somewhere around that.

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,320
But working with Matomo for the last four years at least.

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,600
So why are we here?

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,760
Well, why are we at the MatomoCamp at all?

30
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,800
William Edwin Stemming is actually my favorite quote guy, so we'll start the day with a quote.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:03,680
So why are we using web analytics at all and what is he saying about this?

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,600
Well, because I need to create reports, right?

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,560
Or maybe not, because this is maybe not why we're using web analytics.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,200
His real quote is actually without data, just another guy with opinions and I think this

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,640
sums up why you should use web analytics, even though the first row is probably what

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,080
most people use a tool like Google Analytics because their boss told them they need to

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,320
create reports for their organization.

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,120
But if you think about it, it's the second quote, the real quote that is hopefully why

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,000
you're collecting data about your applications because you want to make decisions that are

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
not based on opinions.

41
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,800
So if we take a little deeper look at this, I usually talk about maturity for organizations

42
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:08,000
when we work with web analytics and I usually divide these into three different categories.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,720
We have the reporting as I joked about in the first step.

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,560
So reporting is really about making data readable for humans.

45
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:27,740
We have a lot of data in our servers or in the Matomo database, but to make it possible

46
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,360
for me or you to understand the data, we need to visualize it, create a table, create a pie

47
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,600
chart or whatever so that we can start to understand the data.

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,040
The second step, when we do have the reporting, we can start to analyze the data, creating

49
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,200
insights basically, or actually trying to create insights because when we do analysis,

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,880
sometimes we can actually come up with an insight.

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,320
So if we break it down again, the first step is about making data readable for humans so

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,960
we can start analyzing.

53
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,340
That's the only value we add to the organization when we start or when we do reporting.

54
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,560
We make it possible for people to do analysis.

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
The analysis step is really about understanding data.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,780
This is where we start to ask why.

57
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:30,400
When we see the page views report, for instance, we really need to...

58
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
So where were we?

59
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,600
I was talking about reporting.

60
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,880
The only value of reporting is actually making data readable for humans.

61
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,840
So when we have the reporting in place, we can start to do analyzes.

62
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,280
We can try to understand the data and this is the step where we ask why repeatedly.

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,360
Why do we have more page views this week than last week, et cetera, et cetera.

64
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,400
When we start to ask these questions and maybe dig into other types of data or when we start

65
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,440
to do combined data, we apply the dimensions we have to the data and twist and turn the

66
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,400
data so that we learn about what we're actually seeing.

67
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,360
We can start to see patterns in the data.

68
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,580
When we see patterns in the data, sometimes this leads us to insights and with these insights,

69
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,680
we can hopefully start to make data-driven decisions.

70
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,440
So think about it again.

71
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,520
When you're just sending email reports around to your organization, what value are you actually

72
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,000
giving the organization?

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,360
Well, not a lot, I would say.

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,360
We really need to get away from this behavior to just create email reports and send them

75
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,200
around because to be honest, the people here at MatomoCamp are probably pretty good at

76
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
the step two and three.

77
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,240
We work with data for a really long time, but sending the page view report to a person

78
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,160
that is not used to working with data, they will come up with bad understandings of the

79
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,440
data.

80
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,000
The most common example is probably when we see that page views has raised and people

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,440
get really happy, but that is for me, the only thing I would do when I see that the

82
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,920
page views has doubled from one week to another is to really be suspicious.

83
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,640
Something must be wrong here, right?

84
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,980
That's the natural behavior of data scientists or data analysts to really start to ask the

85
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,800
question why.

86
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,440
So why am I talking about this when I'm supposed to present a plugin for Matomo?

87
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:56,200
Well, it leads us because I really want us to start creating better decisions, basically.

88
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:05,480
The thing that we're missing in a tool like Matomo is the qualitative data.

89
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:14,560
This is really about getting the full understanding of our users, so we need both of these to

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,760
make really good decisions, and I will try to explain why, because the quantitative data,

91
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,760
the numbers that we collect, they really tell us things like, okay, we got more page views

92
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,080
or more people converted on our site.

93
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,040
We can really validate behaviors or maybe find problems, like if the page views doubled

94
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,480
from last week, maybe we have a problem, maybe we have spam bots getting to our websites

95
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,840
or I don't know, it could be anything.

96
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,680
But to really understand that, we often need qualitative data to understand why people

97
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,320
are angry or yes, they signed up, but were they happy when they did so.

98
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,440
So we really need to understand behaviors or problems, and that we can do with qualitative

99
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
data.

100
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,680
And qualitative data is, of course, when we get emotions or text feedback or whatever.

101
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,440
So this has actually been the reason why I created this plugin, because working with

102
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,760
analytics or websites as a product owner, you really start to understand that you need

103
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,400
more than just the numbers coming from a tool like Matomo or a Web Analytics tool.

104
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,560
So that leads us to my vision for this plugin.

105
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,720
It's been my little baby for, I think I came up with the idea five years ago, and not really

106
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,720
in a Matomo context, but more in a general Web Analytics context where I, of course,

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,600
wasn't using survey tools available online, but I really wanted to have data in combination

108
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
with my Web Analytics data.

109
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,480
And the vision here is really to add qualitative data to Matomo so that we can help users to

110
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,280
make data-driven decisions.

111
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:13,000
And that we can do only if we start to combine the qualitative and quantitative data fully.

112
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,420
And hopefully that's something we can do with this plugin.

113
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,160
So the basic concepts of the plugin is that we can create forms.

114
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,880
There's a form builder in the tool, of course, so we can do this, of course, demo this soon.

115
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,600
And the next step is that we can publish these forms on our websites, of course, and we do

116
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,640
have a great tool for doing so in Matomo already.

117
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,560
So we built this solution around the Tag Manager, so you use the Tag Manager and the knowledge

118
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,680
we already have to publish this service or forms into our website.

119
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,720
And we can also style them within the Tag Manager to decide how the look and feel should

120
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
be.

121
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,000
And last but not least, we can actually collect the data within Matomo and we can use the

122
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,340
standard reporting and we're looking into that soon.

123
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,180
So now I think it's about time to demo this.

124
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,840
So let's look at how this type of feedback can look like.

125
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:25,480
So what we're looking at right now is our website, digitalist.se, and here on a page,

126
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,640
I have a little question, did you find what you were looking for?

127
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,480
We have a yes, no partly, and we can also rate this page and I can send this feedback

128
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,480
and I get a feedback saying thank you for testing.

129
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:48,920
This form here comes from the user feedback survey tool within Matomo and I will soon

130
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,560
show you how the backend interface works.

131
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,800
So going into our Tag Manager, or actually when you install the plugin, you will get

132
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,000
a new menu up here saying user feedback.

133
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,760
So when I click on that, we get more menu items.

134
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,040
So on this page, we can see that all the forms that I created on the site, the concept right

135
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:28,960
now is that we can create templates and the template basically defines the structure of

136
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
the form.

137
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,400
As you can see here, it looks pretty techy if I click edit on this one, you will see

138
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:43,000
that you will get a JSON file defining the fields and the widgets that the form contains.

139
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,680
This is actually something we're rebuilding right now.

140
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,120
So when I release the full version, we will actually not have the templates, but we will

141
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,400
look into that later on.

142
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,680
So how I do this right now is that I create a new form.

143
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:09,160
You can call it Thomas demo form.

144
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,760
Let's give it the description and then I select the template I want to use.

145
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,920
So I will use this one.

146
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,440
And based on what template I select, I get a different set of configurations.

147
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,720
In my template, I can also define the default values for these fields.

148
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,200
So this one is actually a radio widget with three values that I can display to the users.

149
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:46,800
So we can change this to, do you like that or no?

150
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
That's no park.

151
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,200
It's probably a pretty good answer, right?

152
00:13:52,200 --> 00:14:04,800
We can add another options.

153
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,560
We can force the users to write this and then we have this break this page.

154
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:24,400
So great how much you like Matomo, right?

155
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,200
And we have five stars to do that.

156
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:39,400
And then we have send feedback and thank you for your feedback on Matomo is what I will

157
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,280
respond to the users after submitting.

158
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,160
So by doing so, I have created a new form, Thomas demo form.

159
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,240
And after having this form in place, I can go to the tag manager and publish this on

160
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,780
my site or we go to the tag manager.

161
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:08,280
So having this plugin installed, I can just click on create a new tag, scroll down and

162
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,960
select the user feedback tag.

163
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,600
And in this, you have a lot of configuration options.

164
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,160
The first one is to select the form that you want to display.

165
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,840
So down here, I have my demo form.

166
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,520
The second option is that I can decide how to display this.

167
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,720
I will show all these examples pretty soon.

168
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,800
The first one is a model.

169
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:42,600
I will just bring up a model on top of the page and I will not do much more than this.

170
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,240
The second thing is that I need to decide the trigger.

171
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,600
So what will trigger this feedback form?

172
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,480
So I will actually, let's see if I have some good ones here.

173
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,640
I will create a new trigger actually.

174
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,000
I will do it pretty simple.

175
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:13,440
I will do it on a page view where the page URL contains question mark equals demo.

176
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,360
I will explain why I do this.

177
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:28,720
So creating this trigger, I should probably name it better, page view demo.

178
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,400
We're actually live changing our website right now.

179
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:44,240
So after this, I will, of course, publish a new version, create a new version and publish.

180
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,520
And then I can go back to my site.

181
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,200
And what I added was page view trigger.

182
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,360
So I will actually look at this URL parameter.

183
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,800
So if I have the URL parameter, question mark equals demo, this will actually trigger this

184
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
service.

185
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:15,560
And this one is a bit slow on our side, so we'll just make sure it works.

186
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,840
It's actually an issue we have in this particular installation that I need to look into.

187
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
That's another question.

188
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:34,200
Let's see if it's loaded, sorry, I lost it.

189
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Let's see.

190
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
Let's see if it's published as well.

191
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,120
So let's go back again, reload the page.

192
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,880
Okay, so that didn't work.

193
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,680
I think we can go to another page demo.

194
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,560
Sometimes there is caching going on here.

195
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,920
Or I did something wrong.

196
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,640
That might be true as well.

197
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,080
Let's go back to the tag manager and see what I did.

198
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,040
So we have a tag with the demo form.

199
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,720
Oh, I know what I did.

200
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I didn't save, I didn't save it, I think, no, I didn't.

201
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,400
This is something I usually forget.

202
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:42,000
I'd never saved the actual tag, so I wonder why it didn't work.

203
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,960
Hit view demo, and I selected the form called Thomas demo form.

204
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,360
So what I actually forgot was to do the create tag.

205
00:18:52,360 --> 00:19:11,080
I only created the trigger before, so let's publish it.

206
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:20,120
So meanwhile, we're waiting for our slow tag manager publishing.

207
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,880
I can answer the first question I see in the chat.

208
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,920
So how accessible are these forms?

209
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,800
Well, we tried to look into accessibility.

210
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:41,040
Accessibility is quite hard for us to control 100% because we're injecting code into a website

211
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,360
and we're not fully owning this.

212
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:53,320
But the way we try to do it, at least, is to apply as little CSS as possible.

213
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,840
We apply some CSS styling just to make it readable.

214
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,640
So when I've been building this, I've been trying to test it from an accessibility perspective.

215
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:14,440
We also had some accessibility consultants looking into the actual results of the forms.

216
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
All right.

217
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
So now it should be published.

218
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,800
Let's go back to the site and reload and hope yes.

219
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
So do you like Matomo?

220
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Yes, no, partly.

221
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,720
Of course, I like Matomo, and how much do I like it very much?

222
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Sending the feedback.

223
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,960
So it seemed to work now.

224
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,800
So this is the basic concept of how to do this.

225
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,880
So we have the form and we have the tags.

226
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,760
And if you know your way around tag managers, you understand how powerful this is.

227
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:57,440
We can come up with pretty awesome rules on how to display these forms on a website.

228
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:08,280
I will also show you some other examples of how we can display these forms.

229
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,840
Actually, I do have...

230
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:19,480
Let's go back to the form I just created.

231
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,960
There we go.

232
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:28,000
So the first option here was to display this form as a model taking over the page.

233
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,840
But maybe I want to display this as a feedback button instead.

234
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:40,200
So selecting this option gives me the option to control this button.

235
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:47,920
And the default text here is just feedback, but that's called feedback on Matomo instead.

236
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,840
I want to display this on the right side of the page, and we'll just go with the default

237
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,280
options of black text and a grayish background color.

238
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:09,320
And I'll update this and publishing again.

239
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:21,080
Let's see, a bit slow.

240
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
So we have time.

241
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,120
Please ask questions in the chat if you have them.

242
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:33,760
We'll actually do this faster next time.

243
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,560
We don't have to wait for the publishing.

244
00:22:37,560 --> 00:23:00,880
Maybe someone have a solution to why our tag manager is slow.

245
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
This is frustrating.

246
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Okay.

247
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,600
So let's reload the page, and now you can see that we've got a feedback button coming

248
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
up on the right.

249
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,440
So instead of having the overlay, I'm just displaying this as a feedback button and clicking

250
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,440
on that, we bring the form up.

251
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,320
And of course, we continue to click yes.

252
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,440
And right now I'm a bit frustrated because of the slow tag management publishing.

253
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,040
So we'll do three.

254
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
So send feedback.

255
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Okay.

256
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,000
So that's great.

257
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,640
You can see that we can display them in different ways.

258
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,000
I will show the last example later on.

259
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,080
But before that, we go into the actual reporting.

260
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,240
So when you have user feedback installed, you will actually have a new report in your

261
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,240
reporting interface displaying the summits.

262
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,280
So as we built it right now, it's quite techy.

263
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,960
So we will only get information on where this happened on the page URL.

264
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,920
You will get the information about which form we submitted.

265
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,520
This is a form ID.

266
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,040
We also collect the visitor ID.

267
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:23,800
This gives us the option to actually apply segments on top of our form submits.

268
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,440
So having a lot of form feedback on your site.

269
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,280
If you're rating the page or whatever, you can actually start applying.

270
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Okay.

271
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:41,880
I want to see only the visitors with Firefox or maybe from a customer segment coming from

272
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,680
a custom dimension or whatever.

273
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,120
This is actually one of the nicest things about combining the qualitative and quantitative

274
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,560
data within Matomo.

275
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,320
You can apply the segments on top of your feedback service.

276
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,720
The results you can see here, so what's coming in is actually the name of the field and the

277
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,040
data coming in.

278
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,920
This is obviously something that will work to create more visually attractive interface

279
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,840
in the long run.

280
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:22,360
So adding more widgets to display this and even have custom reports coming for the dashboard

281
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,120
where you can select an individual form and present that in different ways.

282
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,160
But for now, we have it in this format.

283
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:37,040
What's really nice is that you can actually export this data already by clicking here

284
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:47,440
and use the API of Matomo to add this feedback data into Excel or whatever.

285
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,800
Yes, a question here, can you filter out based on the responses?

286
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:02,480
So maybe I just want to have people that answered three or lower on this to only get the unhappy

287
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,800
users.

288
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,600
So you can't do it right now in the interface.

289
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,440
We have been playing around with that and it's definitely a feature we plan to release,

290
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,160
but right now you basically have to export the data and do that in an external tool.

291
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,600
But it's definitely something we played around with, but it's been a bit harder than we thought

292
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,040
in the beginning to achieve.

293
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:36,200
But it's still quite powerful to have it in this way.

294
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,960
Another thing is that why can I create a segment based on the rating of the page?

295
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,560
So maybe I want to create a segment based on everyone that voted lower than three to

296
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,740
just segment out unhappy users to start analyzing that.

297
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,000
That's also a feature that we plan to build, of course, not implemented right now, but

298
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,160
it's definitely possible since we're connecting data to visitors and it's more about building

299
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
that interface.

300
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,280
But as you start to understand what it's really, really powerful when you start to combine

301
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:18,840
these data sets with each other to be able to do those things.

302
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
What else?

303
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Let's look at the last option.

304
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Actually if we go back to this page and we scroll down here, you can see that this form

305
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,400
is actually displayed within the markup of the page.

306
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,240
And this is actually the last display type we have.

307
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:53,640
So going back to the Tag Manager, I will actually look at, let's see if I think it's this one.

308
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,820
Yes.

309
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,520
So the styling is called raw inline.

310
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,600
And when I select that, I can also check this one, show advanced display controls.

311
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:16,960
And when I do so, it's getting pretty techy, but I can actually select the query.

312
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,140
It's a query selector.

313
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:29,320
So if I go back to my page and we inspect here and actually see that we have a div called

314
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,840
Feedback Form Demo, and I think this is the one that I use.

315
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Yes.

316
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,440
So I'm having a query selected with the Feedback Form Demo, and this means that the form will

317
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,600
be injected into that div.

318
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,040
That could be anything on the page.

319
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,640
I could go down to the footer and add it to the contact section or whatever.

320
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,560
If you know your JavaScript around, this is pretty simple.

321
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:07,280
What you can also control is whether you want to append it on the end of this element or

322
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,320
on the beginning.

323
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,120
So this is again JavaScript.

324
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,320
So you can decide if you add it to the body feed, for instance, of the page.

325
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,560
You can decide whether to append it in the beginning, before all other elements, or in

326
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,680
the end.

327
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,760
We can also add styling to these forms.

328
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:35,120
So in this case, I wanted a particular background color.

329
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,760
But the nice thing is that we're actually inheriting styles from the site.

330
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:48,680
So since we're adding it to the page, we're actually inheriting fonts and whatever from

331
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
the site.

332
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:58,000
So there are a lot of ways that we can actually add style sheets to our own CMS and just inherit

333
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,160
that to all the forms, which is, of course, a nice feature.

334
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,320
What we also implemented is that we can add event tracking.

335
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,600
So maybe I want to have an event when someone submits this form.

336
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,360
This would, of course, be pretty easy to do directly through the Tag Manager.

337
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,480
But for some people, it might be a bit tricky to do so.

338
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:31,320
So by just checking this one, I get a pre-filled options to add an event category, action,

339
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,280
description, and name and value.

340
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,840
So it would basically just send an event when this happens.

341
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't want this in this case.

342
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,280
So that's this demo.

343
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,080
And I think that pretty much sums up.

344
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:58,040
We also have, if you go back to the user feedback interface, because this can be pretty sensitive,

345
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
this data.

346
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,560
So we have the submissions here.

347
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,440
What you see was just want to delete a feedback.

348
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,480
So this page actually displays the collected feedback.

349
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,800
And I can go in and just delete a single record like this.

350
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:21,120
And here, we can actually filter out.

351
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:29,600
This is actually collecting all the feedback, so I can filter out in different ways and

352
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:46,440
even search for, like, rate this page equals 3, as we have here.

353
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:56,040
This is just for deleting data, so I can do that easily.

354
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,360
Yes, great.

355
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:14,440
To get feedback that you can help me with the segmentation, that sounds super awesome.

356
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Thank you for this, Stefan.

357
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,920
I will definitely contact you about that.

358
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
What else?

359
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:30,160
One important thing is, of course, that since we are collecting sensitive data, we add permissions

360
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,520
to the feedback module.

361
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:49,980
So just to be able to see these reports, you can, on a user level, let's see.

362
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,320
So if I want to give this user some permissions on a particular website, I can actually add

363
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,620
the capability of being a form manager, a form user, and a template manager.

364
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:12,900
So template manager is, of course, adding a template to the site.

365
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,420
Form manager is, of course, creating the form.

366
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:24,000
And then the form user for actually viewing the data on a particular site.

367
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,240
So with both of these things as well.

368
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,560
And of course, tag manager capabilities, if you're going to publish something to the site,

369
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,960
you need to have that.

370
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,760
But that comes from that plugin, of course.

371
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
All right.

372
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,200
So that's actually what I was supposed to demo here.

373
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,560
Let's look at the next thing.

374
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,240
So we're actually building this as a premium plugin.

375
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:01,000
So right now, the pricing is 300 euros per month.

376
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,640
And we plan to release this on the marketplace, but we need to do some code evaluation.

377
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:15,560
If you're a client to Digitalist buying our sauce, the pricing may go down a thousand

378
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
euros.

379
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
But yeah.

380
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:24,440
So the roadmap right now is to release it in Q4.

381
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,980
What we're doing right now is actually refactoring it a bit.

382
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:36,000
So we're actually skipping the parts I displayed with the form template.

383
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,320
So we'll actually demo what we're working on right now pretty soon.

384
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:50,740
But the release is about creating forms, displaying form, data collection, and simple reporting.

385
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,040
We plan to continuously release new versions.

386
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:01,800
So as a client, you will probably get updates every month or so based on feedback from our

387
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,400
users.

388
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:16,320
As part next summer, I think we'll release the first widgets to get more graphical bells

389
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,720
and whistles, so to speak.

390
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,680
And then of course, it's an ongoing thing.

391
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,800
So based on feedback, we'll continue to release more nice things.

392
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:35,200
So let's look at the new form creation tool I'm playing around with.

393
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,560
So instead of having the templates, the plan is to make it look like this, just to have

394
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,120
forms and the ability to create form.

395
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:53,800
So instead of having this really techy JSON file, we plan to do it as this.

396
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:05,960
So just adding, dragging, and dropping fields to your form like this, and being able to

397
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,720
drag them around.

398
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:20,600
Let's add the header again.

399
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:31,280
So being able to do it in a much nicer way, as you see, it's pretty nice to do this.

400
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:39,880
We're actually using an external library to do this, but it gives us really nice ways

401
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,480
for users to understand it.

402
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,460
So after publishing this, I will go to the Tag Manager and just display it on the side.

403
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,240
So let's look at some questions.

404
00:36:51,240 --> 00:37:00,000
I think this is about it for now.

405
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,480
Yes, we have Max writing from experience of working with similar tools in Google Analytics

406
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
and Google Timer.

407
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,480
I think the extra quality data adds an extra dimension when analyzing.

408
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
So great.

409
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Thanks for this.

410
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,360
Yes, Stefan.

411
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:30,600
I think that would be awesome to have a workshop around combining this data with dimensions.

412
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,680
That's really, really, really nice, and thank you for reaching out there.

413
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:43,520
And Michael said that with event tracking, you should be able to filter out segments.

414
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,720
Yes, the problem is that the way we implemented the events right now is that there are actually

415
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:56,240
no connection to the actual user feedback sent in.

416
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:13,560
So that's something we would need to work on.

417
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Yes, another question.

418
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,360
Can I use the form analytics to analyze how users are using forms, or can I get that data

419
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,560
from your plugin?

420
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:36,640
The only thing we have right now is the event tracking built in.

421
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,900
But you could use the form analytics plugin and probably listen to the user feedback forms

422
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:52,920
to get a more detailed analysis of the form usage there, which I think is nice.

423
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,680
But you can also set up manual events on, for instance, if someone starts to interact

424
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,880
with the form.

425
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,160
I have that as an idea to add that type of events as well, but I don't know how much

426
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,920
I want to build into the plugin directly.

427
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:26,760
But if you go to the plugin, go to the tag manager, and at this one, enable event tracking

428
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,640
of feedback forms, I could actually add a button saying enable event tracking for form

429
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,720
interaction and start collecting that as well.

430
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,920
Right now, we decided to just do this.

431
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,160
It's definitely possible to do it manually.

432
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
All right.

433
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:51,960
So, another question was, is it possible to use the feedback forms as segment or reports

434
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,200
for users that gave good, bad ratings or similar?

435
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,360
Yeah, we talked about that already.

436
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,640
Let's see.

437
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,640
I need feedback form after the 10th search result.

438
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,720
Is this possible to define a container in which the feedback form will be inserted?

439
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:20,400
I think that's really up to doing cool things with the tag manager.

440
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,040
And this is also why I really enjoy the tag manager.

441
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,920
One thing we didn't look into, which is pretty nice, is that maybe not asking the question

442
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,440
directly, but having this one in the tag manager by default is really, really nice.

443
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,000
We can actually decide how often this should be displayed to the visitors.

444
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,040
So, once per page view, once per 24-hour, or once in lifetime, or actually every time

445
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,640
someone sees the form.

446
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,920
So these type of great things with the tag manager.

447
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:59,280
But if you go back to the search results, so if you have a site and you want to display

448
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:07,920
this feedback after the 10th form result, I would use the one we looked into before,

449
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:18,040
the raw inline, that would make it possible to just inject the HTML of the form into your

450
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,400
search result list.

451
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,800
So I would say, yes, it's definitely possible, but you need to dig into how your search result

452
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:36,240
page, HTML looks like, but it would definitely be possible.

453
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:44,640
And the other things is like, okay, maybe you have, you can basically use any data on

454
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
the page.

455
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:52,600
So on the 10th page view, after submitting this form or whatever, you can come up with

456
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,920
any ideas of how to do this.

457
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
All right.

458
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,640
So we're actually running out of time.

459
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,960
Thank you for listening.

460
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,360
I hope you liked it, and feel free to continue to ask questions in this group.

461
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:15,720
I'll, yeah, I'll try to answer as much as possible.

462
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:27,680
Any thanks for your session, Thomas, of course, we can continue the conversation in the chat

463
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,000
for other questions that people might have.

464
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yep.

465
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Sounds good.

466
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Thank you, guys.

467
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:53,640
Thank you.
