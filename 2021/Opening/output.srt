1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Okay, so it's currently 9.00 CST time and we are ready to start this historical moment

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,640
which is the first MatomoCamp ever. Welcome to the MatomoCamp opening ceremony. My name

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:33,280
is Renan and I'm here with Lukas Winkler. Lukas, can you hear us? Yes, I can hear you fine

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:42,800
and welcome to everyone here. So this MatomoCamp opening ceremony will last about 30 minutes in

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,800
which we will explain to you what this MatomoCamp is about, how you can take part of it as well

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,160
as presenting the different organizers, so as the different speakers that we will have during

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,000
the next two days. So what this event is about, this event is about spreading the knowledge

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,760
about Matomo Analytics which is the number one free software web analytics platform which of course

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,920
that most of you guys know which gives you 100% data ownership. If you don't know yet

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,760
Matomo, please do not hesitate to scan the QR code which is on this slide which will make you

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,720
land on matomo.org and you can as well already have a look at the solution if you just type

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:43,600
within your URL bar demove.matomo.cloud. So what is the history of the event? Why are we

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,400
holding it today? So in fact it just started with a bunch of Matomo passionate talking,

14
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:02,480
Lukas, myself and other guys and that's not probably the best storytelling ever that we're

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,440
going to have here but it's just like people talking together and saying hey why don't we

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:17,200
create a MatomoCamp and here we are. So it's not about great ideas coming, it's just the fact that

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,840
we realized that it was probably the good time to organize one because we started to have a lot of

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,320
people from around the world asking a lot of questions, setting up businesses about Matomo

19
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,280
and then this is where we say okay we have a high interest of communicating together, of spreading

20
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,800
knowledge or helping our businesses, companies to grow, helping Matomo to develop and so on and so

21
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,720
forth and that's the reason why we decided to create an ambitious project which is a Matomo

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,360
camp which consists of spreading knowledge between all the people around the world.

23
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,680
We wanted when we created this event to keep the free software philosophy by saying that and mean

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,000
that we are excluding in organizing this event all the proprietary solution, all the proprietary

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,320
software in order to organize it and we decided to really challenge ourselves by using only

26
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:26,080
free software technology. So instead of taking just one technology which is gathering everything

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,600
that we needed, we take the bet that we could organize a quality event by just taking free

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,240
software pieces. So of course we would like to thank the community and of course the different

29
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,480
software editor of those free software platforms that we are using for this event. Of course by

30
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,760
starting by Matomo, Matomotics which is the number one free software web analytics platform,

31
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,920
then BigBlueButton which is the video conference software that we are using right now with Lukas

32
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,840
in order to make this conference. During all the event long you will have the possibility to chat

33
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,760
with all the communities through Element which is an instant chat messaging system. The different

34
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,600
files that we use for the organization of the events so as many different applications have

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,560
been used thanks to a solution which is named Nextcloud. Most of the servers which are running

36
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:44,960
the different apps that we have now are using an Nginx software platform. Lukas you can correct me

37
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,680
if I'm wrong but KDNLive is the software which is used in order to make the streaming part am I

38
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,040
right? And no it's a video editing software we will be using in the next weeks to edit together

39
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,320
all the recordings before we can publish them on the website. Oh great thanks. Before the event

40
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,720
we created a survey over the summer in order to know what were the expectations of the Matomo

41
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,160
community. We used for that a survey software named LimeSurvey. In order to organize the schedule,

42
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
gather all the different needs from the speakers, their presentation and so on and so forth.

43
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:34,560
We use a great software named Pretalks. In order to add the matomocamp.org website we use a famous

44
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,960
CMS named WordPress. In order to send the newsletter by which we collected the different

45
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,440
emails from matomocamp.org we used a software named PHPList. And as well in order to make people

46
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,840
interactive and more during the event we are using a software named WorkAdventure and I precise

47
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,840
that no free software were harmed during this organization. Maybe the logos when I try to

48
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,320
resize them for this given slide. And I apologize as well for all the other free software that we

49
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,280
may have used along the process but that I may have forgotten to add within these slides.

50
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,000
I would like to thank our partners for the event. This event is mostly relying on a very low budget

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,480
and as well on the best effort system which means that it's mostly relying on the time and energy

52
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,920
that each individual of the organizing team are putting on it. But I really would like to thank

53
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:44,960
in particular the Matomo team who accepted for us to use a logo which is similar to the one of

54
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:54,640
the Matomo. As well I would like to say huge thanks to Empreinte Digital who is the company

55
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,560
who is let's say running all the streaming infrastructure and who is putting a lot of human

56
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,240
resources and energy in holding this event. I would like as well to thank Mist Analytics who

57
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:16,720
invested some time and budget in order to create the logo. I would like as well to thank the Sonora

58
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:27,200
company who as well put some energy in it so as purchasing the domain name of matomocamp.org.

59
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,760
And as well I would like to thank Stairs for the investment that they make within the template of

60
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,040
the WordPress website. So to say we are really running this event with a very small budget

61
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,840
and I really would like to thank all the different individuals who are the organizers of the Matomo

62
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,680
Camp event because they gave a lot of their time. Mostly those are women and men business

63
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,480
and they really spent a lot of energies in this event on their working time.

64
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,600
About the organizing team, you will have the possibility to see all of them either as speakers

65
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,160

66
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,520
within the event, myself, so Renan Chardonneau. Silva Harapi, she's been the one in charge of

67
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,800
all the communication that you may have seen either on the website or either on the social network.

68
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,240
Peter Bolk who is the guy who deals with all the system administration part with the help of Lukas.

69
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,440

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,800

77
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,920

behind Matomo Analytics. You will get as well Nathan Freitas, you will get as well

79

84
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:30,000
chance to have today from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and as well tomorrow from 9 to 5 p.m. CST time. Lukas,

85
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:39,440
I can give you the floor now. Yes, so I will be talking a bit about how you can participate

86
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,880
in the event. So of course most of you have already seen our nice schedule where you have a

87
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,840
nice time overview when which talk or workshop will take place to day and tomorrow. You might

88
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,400
probably have also seen our live streaming page live.matomocamp.org where all of our

89
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,240
talks are streamed live into two rooms at the same time and there you can also join the workshops

90
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,240
and can you go to the next slide please. And so if you want to participate in the event you can

91
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,560
watch all of the talks on live.matomocamp.org you can see the live streams there. If you want to

92
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:30,320
ask questions to the speakers we have a chat room for every single talk on chat.matomocamp.org or

93
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:40,080
the chat room is also visible below the live stream. And you can also find on chat.matomocamp.org

94
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,280
you can find multiple chat rooms where you can talk to other participants about Matomo,

95
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:55,040
about Matomo business related things and other topics. And as a slight bonus in case you don't

96
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,680
really care that much about the talks themselves and are more interested in meeting up with other

97
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:09,120
Matomo users and want to know their experience, talk to them, we have a work adventure platform

98
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:17,840
on meet.matomocamp.org and there you can join and talk to other people in groups or together

99
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:26,560
in a voice or video chat. So if you're interested in talking to other people you can go to meet.matomocamp.org

100
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,520
and one more note at the end the whole event is planned in central european time so at the moment

101
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:41,440
that's central that's UTC plus one hour. So if you are not from central europe please stay keep

102
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,840
that in mind whenever you look at the schedule and other things just so you don't arrive at the wrong

103
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:58,080
hour. So thanks that's it for me back to Renat. Okay yeah I just would like to precise just one

104
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,240
tiny thing is that you don't need to register to anything in order to attend the event you just

105
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:13,200
need to go on live.matomocamp.org and from the time schedule which will start in 10 am so in 45

106
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,320
minutes from now you will have the possibility to pick up either room number one or either room

107
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,080
number two so you just need to go on live.matomocamp.org and make the choice in order to see the

108
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,160
conference that you want to attend to. If you would like during this conference to ask questions

109
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,160
to the speaker the only thing that you need to do is that you need to go and chat.matomocamp.org

110
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:44,000
and here you will need to register to this platform and once you register to the platform

111
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,040
you will have the possibility to ask as many questions as you want to any conference that

112
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,880
you are looking at and or interact with any other Matomo users let's say attendees to the events

113
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,040
by using this platform so of course that's a great place in order to connect. Let's imagine that

114
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,760
you are looking for someone in order to help you about some Matomo issues that you are facing on

115
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,920
a day-to-day basis that's typically the place where you cannot do it but if you would like to

116
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,560
have more interaction like seeing the person that you like to discuss with in face-to-face

117
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,000
you can use this platform which is meet.matomocamp.org which does not require much registration as you

118
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,440
just need to put a nickname and you are ready to go so just to let you know that live.matomocamp.org

119
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,600
won't allow you to interact with the speakers that's through chat.matomocamp.org that you

120
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,400
can do it and that you can interact with other either through chat.matomocamp.org by text message

121
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:59,680
or either by video cam system on meet.matomocamp.org. And one more thing related to this if you have any

122
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,920
questions to ask the organizers have any troubles or unsure about how something works correctly

123
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,640
on chat.matomocamp.org we also have an info desk chat room where you can write something and we

124
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,200
will see it immediately and in case if something is broken enough that you can't even connect to

125
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:28,640
the chat you can also find the contact form on the Matomocamp website where you can send us a message

126
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:39,040
and we will reply via email. So we are a bit ahead of this time schedule we planned this opening

127
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,480
ceremony to be 30 minutes long and we made it in 15 minutes that's great because it gives you some

128
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:54,880
time to go on chat.matomocamp.org to already test the platform to see if you can register to it

129
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,080
easily to already start to connect with other attendees. You can of course go as well on

130
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:08,160
meet.matomocamp.org and start to connect with other people. Just to let you know that the

131
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,360
first session of today will start in 45 minutes from now so let's say 10 a.m. There's no reason

132
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,800
why they won't start on time so I think that at 10 a.m. it will be good. Probably out of the main

133
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:32,080
questions that you're going to ask is will those talk will be recorded? The answer is yes of course

134
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,080
we have some moderators and moderators have the responsibility to record each session and when

135
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,720
the sessions will be available well we may need of course to make some cut some adjustment within

136
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,160
the recording but they will probably arrive just some days after the event. Just to let you know

137
00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:00,560
that one month before we created a pre-matomocamp event which was for topic the matomo tag manager

138
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,440
so it was a 45 minutes conference and this recording has been put online probably like

139
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,360
two or three days just after it so you can expect just a one week delay in order to have the recording

140
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,520
online it's not going to take like like a month. Lukas do you have anything that you would like to

141
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,760
add or say to our attendees today? No nothing for my end apart from of course wishing everyone a

142
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:37,040
nice matomocamp today and tomorrow. Okay that's great so yes welcome everyone to a matomocamp

143
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,760
enjoy it as much as you can. Next session will start at 10 a.m so in the meantime you can relax
