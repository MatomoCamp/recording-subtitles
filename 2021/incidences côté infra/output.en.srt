00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,120
Hello everyone and welcome to this second day of the MatomoCamp.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,400
So for the moment everything is going well, I hope that will be the case throughout this

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,320
second day. We are lucky and honored today to receive Valentin Bares who works

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,080
at Empreinte Digital and who is actually the person who manages all the streams that we

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,520
have today and that we had yesterday in MatomoCamp. Just to say a few words about Valentin,

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,480
so Valentin is DevOps at Empreinte Digital which is a company located in Angers. His main

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,120
mission is the deployment and maintenance of the cloud structure in SAS mode of the Empreinte

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,040
Digital which is a data center that is spread between Angers, Rennes and Tours. In this

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,960
conference, Valentin will tell us how we manage a Matomo instance on a daily basis,

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,160
whether it is an instance that is very simple, that does not have a lot of traffic,

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,400
up to an instance that has up to 5 million visitors per month. So it is above all a

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,120
conference in experience return mode for nearly two years. Empreinte Digital and Valentin

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,440
are currently managing a client that some of you may know, which is PIX. PIX is

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,960
actually a platform that allows you to test digital knowledge which is notably used

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,600
in the world of higher education. It is a little bit the equivalent of TOEIC but

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,600
in digital culture mode. So it's a little bit like how we could see it in the

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,680
conference yesterday hosted by Roré from the Digitalist AB team. We are on a site

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,240
that receives a lot of traffic and which manages to keep up with a Matomo who is

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,840
there to monitor all of this. That's it. Listen, I'm going to leave the floor to Valentin. Do not hesitate

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,840
during the whole conference to interact, to ask questions on the platform which I remind you is

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,560
chat.matomocamp.org on which you can register. You have a room that corresponds

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,140
to the conference we currently have. You ask all your questions there. And if you

23
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,640
want to continue to ask questions to Valentin, do not hesitate to use this chat

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:37,040
which will be active for the whole day. I wish you all a very good conference.

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,480
Hello everyone. So first of all I'm going to try to fix a little problem at the

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,960
level of the conference because a priori it does not appear. So I'm going to allow myself to

27
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:59,240
upload the conference to you. These are the little direct alerts we are going to say.

28
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,320
So

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm sorry for this little setback.

30
00:03:41,320 --> 00:04:11,160
Downloaded. So hello everyone.

31
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,720
My name is Valentin. Thank you Renan for giving me the floor to talk to you about what is a

32
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,880
upload of Matomo. So we're going to talk about how it is possible to create a Matomo

33
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,640
instance easily. To show how easy it is to set up and maintain a software.

34
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,920
And also to see how it is possible to upload up to loads that we

35
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,480
were able to meet yesterday in the first day up to 50 million visits per month, etc.

36
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,880
So first of all, who am I? My name is Valentin Barret. I am a DevOps Engineer at

37
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:00,000
Empreinte Digital. We have been running Matomo for a little over two years. We started

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,240
little by little on this software by obviously appetizing to open source and to

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,080
offer additional service to our customers. And so for two years we have acquired a lot of

40
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,200
experience until we will see, we will reach rather interesting numbers on the

41
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:28,520
management of Matomo instances. So do I have to introduce Matomo? Well, not really,

42
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,880
we are at MatomoComp, but I still wanted to say a few things. It was that Matomo,

43
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,040
it is formerly Peweak, that it has existed for a very long time. It is an open source software

44
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,480
for web statistics, successor to PHP MyVisit and designed to be an alternative

45
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,520
free to Google Analytics, Matomo works on PHP and MySQL servers. And as Renan

46
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,120
said very precisely yesterday, you should know that Matomo is neither more nor less than a database

47
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,240
with data that we collect as we go. And what is also interesting is to

48
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,960
say that Matomo is a software that has existed for years and years and that it is based

49
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:12,640
on essentially two bricks, PHP and MySQL. So it's only two simple components

50
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,800
that allow you to have a tool as powerful as Matomo. PHP which will allow you to process

51
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,280
information, so obviously there is a bit of language, now there is JavaScript, there is PHP,

52
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,160
there is a little more tuning around all that, but originally you have to know that it is really

53
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,360
two technologies, the simplest possible to create analytics tools that we know today.

54
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,400
So the first approach with Matomo. So I have my little images that do not work

55
00:06:41,400 --> 00:07:09,080
because of the PDF rendering, but it does not matter. The first approach with Matomo. So I just want to tell you the story of the

56
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,280
implementation of Matomo as we could hear it today. That is to say that I place myself

57
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,560
as a dev, I am not a dev, I am a sysops with a dev habitat, but I place myself

58
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,760
as a dev, I have an application, I want to test the audience, Google I do not like it too much,

59
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:29,840
I know that there are some privacy problems, I have RGPD, etc. So I tell myself,

60
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,920
I type on Google, I easily come across Matomo and I tell myself that it seems to correspond to my needs,

61
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,560
in addition, I looked at the list of integrations, I can integrate it very easily in WordPress,

62
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,200
in Hugo, etc. There are more than 40 integrations that have been created by the community.

63
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:53,440
So I tell myself, but ok, perfect, I'm going to put a piece in this software.

64
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:01,480
And so there, what I can see is that Matomo can track up to more than 100,000 pages,

65
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:08,680
so page views per month, with, let's say, quite a few resources, that is to say 2 CPUs,

66
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:16,080
2 GB of RAM and 50 GB of SSD for the disk in particular. So that means that on my application

67
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,160
that I put at my disposal for my development, which aims to sell, I am a dev,

68
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,760
I created a product, I want to sell it, I want to make it known, etc. And I want to see

69
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,000
how the users use it. And well, quite simply, I will be able to track,

70
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,840
let's say, the user on the functioning of my website. And all this without changing hosting,

71
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,280
without adding CPU cores, because I took a forfeit at OVH, at Scaleway, at Emprunt Digital,

72
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:59,640
and it is possible to have my hosting next to my Matomo. So it's easy to install,

73
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,120
I have my integrations, easy to maintain, it's PHP with a database, there may be

74
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,080
some surprises, but overall all the updates are going pretty well. It corresponds to all my

75
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,520
needs. My goal at the beginning is to really have my page views, to know how many people

76
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,120
access my application and how many pages of my application have been consulted, etc.

77
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,400
And it works automatically, that is to say that once we have installed the Matomo,

78
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,400
once we have put the tracking, the data almost easily enter the application

79
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:40,120
and it is possible, in addition to that, to consult them so easily. So there,

80
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:48,840
the image is missing, it doesn't matter, I'm talking about 100 to 1 million users,

81
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,880
but for now you offer us to have an installation for a few users, because I remind you

82
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:02,080
that here, my goal at the beginning was to create my application, to have tracking,

83
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,600
but I know that when I start a business, unless I have been driven by big guys,

84
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,960
I will only have a few users who will, how to say, consult my application at the beginning.

85
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:22,080
So you tell us, I'm going to go from 100 users to more than a million,

86
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,840
but how are we going to do it because we are on an installation that is 2 CPUs,

87
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:35,320
2 GB of RAM, and in addition to that you show us that the requirements can go only up to

88
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,400
100,000 pageviews per month. No, no, I'm not fooling you, don't worry,

89
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,360
my application works well, we want more visitors, I have more visitors,

90
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,720
my business is developing, it's great, I go from me alone in my garage to a little more

91
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,120
in my company that I created in order to develop my product, and so I have a team

92
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,640
around that in the company. We are now 3-4 devs, I had a web analyst

93
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:20,040
enter my company because we know that it is also important today to know the

94
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:27,760
audience, especially on products in extra web. And so suddenly the web analyst tells me

95
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,240
oh there we are starting to have a lot of traffic, but on the other hand there is a latency for my access to my

96
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,120
Matomo. So a little aside, I'm talking to you about a feedback, it's pretty much

97
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
what we had, that is to say that more than two years ago, it's been a long time since we used Matomo,

98
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,080
but it's been more than two years now that we're trying to promote it, also for our

99
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:57,160
clients I mean. We were using Matomo and we realized that damn the access now to the

100
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,840
websites could be a little slower by a few milliseconds, but the web analyst

101
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,480
told us yeah it's still a bit embarrassing because it slows down almost the entire stack

102
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,320
just because we added tracking. So there is a pretty simple tip to improve

103
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,400
the experience in terms of access to tracking and therefore easier recording.

104
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,000
So we talked about it yesterday with the first talks of Tips and Tricks, and then

105
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,160
globally all the people who talked about infrastructure. The must-have in this case,

106
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,760
and in almost all Matomo installations, is obviously the Qt tracking.

107
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:48,240
What is Qt tracking? Well, it's the tailing of the statistics, how to say,

108
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,840
of the user's follow-up code in a queue. So here we are talking about Redis or MySQL,

109
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:04,320
which will allow us to wait for the records of the website and to ingest them,

110
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,160
to feed them by MySQL in batches, that is to say that rather than putting them one by one

111
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,800
as we go along and having a complete follow-up of the request until it is stored,

112
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,400
here we are going to put the different requests in a box and once this box is filled,

113
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:30,200
we put it in, how to say, Matomo's PHP, which will say, oh look, the box is filled,

114
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,240
I'm going to put this box directly to the database. And that, by the way, greatly improves

115
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:43,200
the performance. So that's what I'm saying, the principle is simple, a waiting line

116
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,680
to record more quickly the accesses and reduce the load in a tight flow. More info,

117
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,200
I put the link of the plugin QtTracking, do not hesitate to go and check it out,

118
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,600
it is really very interesting and we have been able to see it over the different conferences,

119
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:04,800
it is a must-have. So it's great, I have a demo, I'll try to do it,

120
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:12,960
I hope it works, otherwise I'll skip it and then it's not very fun. So it's great,

121
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:20,520
the web analyst tells me, great, thanks to your little optimizations, you were able to

122
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:28,360
increase the score of the page load, etc. And on top of that, we didn't need to

123
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,880
take up an additional hosting, oh damn, I'm sorry, the diagram doesn't work,

124
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:47,760
it doesn't matter, I'll do it for you. We will say that we have the users here, we have

125
00:14:47,760 --> 00:15:17,200
the matomo here, finally the inframatomo, we improvise, it doesn't matter. And so, where before I had my matomo with my database,

126
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:35,840
I could, so I'm just going to make a little note here, and add here. So the users

127
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,400
arrive on matomo and there is a connection between the database and matomo, we were able to add

128
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:49,800
here what we call QtTracking via a Redis database. And so from an infrastructure point of view,

129
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,280
it's very simple, we have the user who will record the requests in the matomo,

130
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,200
and rather than going from matomo to the database, we will go through the Redis which will allow us

131
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,240
to stamp all of these requests and therefore to avoid overloading the PHP used by matomo

132
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,280
and also by the application, we can imagine that it is a Wordpress, a Drupal, any PHP application,

133
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,560
and therefore that the PHP is shared. And so rather than overloading the PHP of the entire machine,

134
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,800
so the small VPS that we can imagine, we will just pass the plates in the Redis and matomo

135
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:31,600
will act, we will say at an almost regular interval, to launch the integration of the requests

136
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,720
in the database. So we have a very simple infrastructure, we can scale, so we went from

137
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:48,160
a few users to, we will say, we can perhaps imagine several thousand users in the infrastructure

138
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:57,200
without changing much. QtTracking is a really important asset in matomo. And that's

139
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,840
great, that is to say that even if we have our business that is increasing, that we have more and more

140
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:14,280
users, we have a small plugin to install and let's go, we can delay the increase

141
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:22,360
of the infrastructure. So the demo, I'm not going to do it, we'll do it at the end if I have time

142
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:33,320
to really show you how effective it is. In theory, the demo is a success.

143
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,800
And so I ask myself the question of how to make sure of the point of break. Obviously there I

144
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:47,120
told you, the web analyst told us, here I would like to increase the response time of

145
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:56,680
access to tracking, so small JS or small PHP request, etc. for matomo. But there is another

146
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,520
problem, that is to say that obviously we delay the increase of the infrastructure. I remember

147
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,640
earlier we were on two 2 GB RAM CPUs, 50 SSDs. Come on, we said to ourselves, we went from 4 GB RAM CPUs,

148
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,040
great, we were able to increase the load even more, but now I'm starting to have a lot of

149
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:26,160
slowdowns on my application, as much as cms, imagine it's a cms, than for the integration of

150
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,800
data in matomo. And on top of that, I have the impression that sometimes it's not quite representative

151
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:39,560
of what can happen. So how to detect problems? So obviously the first problem

152
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,880
which is quite simple to identify is the slow access. We have trouble accessing the application,

153
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:55,360
rather than loading the application in 1 second, 500 milliseconds, etc. We find ourselves at 3-4

154
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,120
seconds, we have errors 500 in server and in addition we have timeouts that appear in the

155
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:10,080
vhost, in the matomo application. So small aside, second small aside, I'm talking about

156
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,200
concepts, I'm not talking about techno. All this can be done in barmetal, in container, in sass,

157
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
knowing that the sass obviously it's not really you who manage, but we can still

158
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,760
realize small slow access and small timeouts, even errors 500 if we have monitoring etc.

159
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,760
In short, I'm talking about concepts and there is no techno behind all this, you do it as you

160
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,240
want. This is also the advantage of this matomo application, it's PHP, so it's

161
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,560
relatively standard, so you do it roughly as you want. So how to detect problems?

162
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,800
These small indicators can tell us, ah it's weird, that's it, my matomo I have the impression that it is

163
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,600
a little overloaded. So how can we increase the load? So I said a little bit

164
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,560
earlier, we can increase the cpu, we can increase the memory and hop it starts again,

165
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,320
indeed we can increase the cpu, we can increase the memory and it starts again,

166
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:10,360
we will say almost. It's not that complicated to increase the load, but we can't increase

167
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:17,840
infinitely, that is to say that at one point we are not going to order machines with 128 cpu,

168
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,680
3 terabytes of ram, 6 terabytes of storage, just for the pleasure of our eyes, we will say, and to

169
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,680
say to ourselves, it's good, I'm going to manage my matomo infrastructure. No, it can't work like that.

170
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:36,240
For what reason? Simply high availability. Our business, we started from a developer

171
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,320
to a team of developers and now that's it, I feel like I'm well into the business and

172
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:50,240
then it's really part of the identity now, the analytics, I offer products with

173
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,360
analytics etc. So it really has to be that this matomo infrastructure is a key point

174
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,720
and an additional motivation to ensure it in the infrastructure of my company. And

175
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,600
so for that, you obviously have to have high availability. High availability goes through

176
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:14,800
what? Well, through a lot of things that we will see just after. So can we scale horizontally?

177
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm sorry, every time there are small diagrams but I will provide them to you after with the

178
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,040
PDF better generated. So can we scale horizontally? In high availability,

179
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,120
we can ask ourselves this question. Can we scale horizontally? Yes we can.

180
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,920
What components? The PHP application, the Redis, the database and of course we don't forget,

181
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,320
last but not least, a LB. LB for calls, for technical names or for techniques,

182
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,400
the load balancer, so to manage the load on the different PHP applications.

183
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,640
The advantage is that it is an application that is in PHP, which has different components,

184
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,040
which can work in different ways. We have seen it with the different conferences,

185
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,680
especially with the conference of our Italian friends, which was great,

186
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,760
I really invite you to go and see it. They have really separated each PHP component

187
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:22,000
with the cron, the task scheduler, the tracking, etc. So great, we know that Matomo,

188
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,360
we can scale it. That's good news. That is to say that from now on, we are able to

189
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,680
switch from a small infrastructure on a server, a database, to different servers,

190
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,920
a Redis database that can be clustered, several databases that can do read-write, etc.

191
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:49,120
In short, a pleasure. And here we don't have the infrastructure. So I'm going to

192
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:59,960
allow myself to add a small image because I find this one rather interesting. So I

193
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:13,600
ask you two minutes. On the page to manage the infrastructure, it is also to know the tools

194
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,400
for the Matomo camp. So I can afford to offer you the possibility to see what I

195
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,120
wanted to show you. And so now we end up with an infrastructure that is more complex.

196
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,400
So this is the visualization of what I was explaining to you just before. We have the

197
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,520
requests that arrive, we have a load balancer that is distributed on the different Matomo. So it

198
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,680
can be full applications or not, as I said at the moment, with different microservices,

199
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:46,400
which uses a Redis cluster or a Redis node. In short, there are plenty of solutions. And then

200
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,520
we have a MySQL database that is in replication, master-master, master-slave. In short,

201
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,160
obviously, we have plenty of imagination to improve the infrastructure. Obviously,

202
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:07,240
it is also limited by the choices that have been made by Matomo. We talked about it yesterday

203
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,040
with the different databases that would like to be integrated into Matomo. This is

204
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:21,040
the result of the MySQL that I took, obviously. Success! In relation to our little installation,

205
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,120
we asked ourselves questions and we realized now that it was possible to have

206
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:33,080
a Matomo infrastructure of highly available and scalable production. Great,

207
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:41,120
we went from 100,000 to more than 100 million visits per month. It's not me who said it,

208
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,880
it's obviously the Matomo requirements page. And I schematize a little because in fact,

209
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,200
once we understood how it was possible to add this or that component,

210
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,240
of what is this or that component, it is easy to... I say easy because we will see

211
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,520
that there are small subtleties, but it is relatively easy to understand how we can

212
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,040
increase the load of our Matomo. And I didn't talk about it, but we can even,

213
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,880
once we are comfortable with the infrastructure, we are comfortable with the different elements

214
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,680
that we have put at the level of tracking, etc. Put our little JavaScript code on a

215
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:31,120
CDN to further increase the possibility of quick access to different points of the globe.

216
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:38,640
I didn't show you that. Obviously, all of this can be done in bar-metal clusters,

217
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,760
in Kubernetes clusters, in SWAM clusters. I remind you, I'm not talking about techno,

218
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,520
I'm talking about concepts. Here we are on things that allow us to understand how

219
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,000
it is easy to go from 100 to several million users per month.

220
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,360
Well, a little surprise that we had in our experience is that the web analyst

221
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,840
wants to use a tag manager because the goal is to have even more ways to analyze the

222
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,200
use of the site. Great! Renan will tell you about it, tag manager is a great tool,

223
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,480
Renan Chardonneau and Renan Hélo, I remember, who talk about it regularly. These are great

224
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:25,320
tools, but we realized one thing, it is that in a clustered environment,

225
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,560
the tag manager is not really designed to be clustered. So there are issues

226
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:38,440
in this sense. We, in our case of client experience and return of experience,

227
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,360
had to find a solution relatively quickly. So how did we figure it out?

228
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,360
What does a tag manager mean? In fact, the tag manager cannot be

229
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,800
clustered, it cannot be used on all nodes. In fact, the tag manager is generated

230
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,960
locally on an PHP instance, which means that it depends on which worker it is generated

231
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,480
when an administrator uses the platform. So, quite simply, when an update

232
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,040
of the tag manager is done, if there is not something that allows you to link

233
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,200
the different... so here we are talking about javascript, the different javascripts

234
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,000
so that it is common between the different workers, there can be inconsistencies,

235
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,200
that is to say that a client, a user will arrive on version 1 of the tag manager while

236
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,400
the other will arrive on a version 2. It is not really the spirit that we want to have

237
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:38,400
and the behavior that we want to have. So for that, we had to... well,

238
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,680
we can ask the question of does that mean that the tag manager is not

239
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,360
clustered on the most complex platforms with different nodes? So that's not what

240
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,000
I mean. No, no, we can do it, of course, but there are a few tricks to achieve

241
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:05,440
the expected result. So, here I am talking about that. We could use a shared

242
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,640
file system between the different workers to have exactly the same code. So what

243
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
Mattomo recommends is that you have to synchronize when you are in a clustered environment

244
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,600
the PHP configuration. So this is typically the, we will say, base of knowledge

245
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,040
of the configuration of Mattomo and upload all the files and plugins

246
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,600
on each server. Okay, so actually, you need to have about the same base.

247
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:40,360
How can we make sure that there is always the same codebase etc. and on top of that,

248
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,600
reduce the perfs, avoid using an NFS or a shared file. I like hypotheses

249
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,600
or even an S3, etc. I don't want to lose too much performance because obviously

250
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:59,240
my application is clustered, etc. So suddenly, we say to ourselves, we have to synchronize everything,

251
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,400
but in the base of Mattomo, there is also the TMP and in the TMP, it is there that

252
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,360
the tag manager is generated, the tag manager JavaScript. And then we realize that, is

253
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,680
it really important to generate the TMP because it also contains a lot of things,

254
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:24,000
cache, etc. Does that mean that it is a file that is very regularly

255
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,240
written, with potentially a lot of access, etc. So if we put a shared file system,

256
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,840
this shared file system must be very efficient. So there, the same, to

257
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,360
redo the little aside, I'm talking about concepts and I say to myself, at the beginning, I don't want to

258
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,280
spend thousands of cents on super complex file systems, etc. so that it works.

259
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:57,000
So what can I do? So there, I'll do it for you. What can I do?

260
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,640
I have no solution, my tag manager is generated aside and if I want to update it,

261
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,360
I have to go to the machines, that I copy it, finally I don't know how to do it. So we,

262
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,240
the solution that we found, in any case in the emergency, finally in the emergency,

263
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,920
not in the emergency but in our case that we had, was to use SingSing. So SingSing,

264
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I don't know if you know what it is, but it is a small tool that allows you to synchronize

265
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,720
different repertoires and in addition to that there is a management of the different versions of

266
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,720
files that have been synchronized. It's not live, it's in sync, but be careful,

267
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,520
we're talking about in sync in a few milliseconds. And above all, it avoids having

268
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:47,400
locks or a file system that is dependent on another machine and in addition to that,

269
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,040
avoiding concurrent accesses at the file system level. In short, we synchronized the tags. Great,

270
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,880
that is to say that we have our tag manager which is now available on all of our workers

271
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:05,840
and which allows web analysts who connect to the platform to take care of creating

272
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,840
the different tags etc. and to put them into production instantly. So obviously,

273
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm talking about our case, it's a REX, we used SingSing, there are lots of other solutions,

274
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:24,600
it's up to you to do whatever you want. I found it interesting to talk about this little case

275
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:32,120
of the tag manager which is now almost an essential part of the use of Matomo

276
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,560
and which suddenly caused us some problems in our Matomo administration. So let's

277
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,720
make a point. I remind you that at the beginning we had our little dev who was alone on his project

278
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:54,920
who started to have his business which increased and suddenly he hired people, he hired

279
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:01,040
admins, he hired devops. In short, it's good, it's a company that is well oiled,

280
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:09,640
that uses Matomo at scale etc. And all that, I didn't tell you, but obviously these are

281
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,880
maintenance that can be done almost without downtime. I remind you that a database,

282
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,560
it is possible to put it into replication easily, it is possible to create a new Matomo worker,

283
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:28,000
to put in front a load balancer. So suddenly, the time to stop a Matomo on our

284
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,240
tiny 2GB RAM CPU, I redirect the traffic. We managed to scale the entire application,

285
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,520
to go from 100 users to more than a million, almost without downtime, by asking ourselves the

286
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,440
right questions, by having had a little feedback, by realizing that finally

287
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,680
the Matomo application was sufficiently well done to be able to scale it horizontally.

288
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,080
And especially by adding the Qt tracking which is a very important component in terms of

289
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,560
performance but also in terms of maintenance. I didn't talk about it obviously but the Qt tracking

290
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,240
also allows during maintenance to continue to recover the data. So it will

291
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,560
store them, store them, store them. And once the maintenance is finished, it will take them,

292
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,160
send them to the database and it will resume the course of its life, we will say, to store

293
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,680
the requests as and when needed. So great, but finally in summary, what did we see?

294
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:31,080
Well in summary, we saw that Qt tracking is a must-have. So I will answer questions

295
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,280
after but I saw a very small one from Ronan who was talking about the fact that Matomo is

296
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,640
important even on small instances. For me yes it is very important because it improves

297
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,120
a lot of things and it allows you to absorb traffic peaks. Can we scale easily?

298
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,520
Yes we can scale easily. We saw it in the concepts, it's easy. There are even

299
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,720
little tips for the tag manager when we have problems. Obviously there are always

300
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:04,880
some concerns about the load. We agree on that. I invite you to go

301
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:12,640
see yesterday's conferences. There were several who talked about these little problems,

302
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,960
we will say. And really they made very enriching feedback also on the

303
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:29,000
management and the scale of Matomo. So here I am. I will allow myself to show you

304
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:39,840
the slide, the little photo because normally I have a small image that is displayed.

305
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:53,080
We are in summary. We can go from a few hundred users per month to more than

306
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:02,680
5 million users. This is really a concrete case. It is thanks to our experience

307
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:11,560
of getting in charge that we get to this result. We reached more than 5 million

308
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,720
visits, more than 100 million views, more than 131 million shares. Obviously if you

309
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,280
are not necessarily familiar with Matomo, it may not be worth talking to you. But

310
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,200
these are figures that are quite impressive and on which we are rather satisfied

311
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,200
within the digital footprint team on our use and our getting in charge with Matomo.

312
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,680
Do we have anything else to say? Yes, because there we talked about getting in charge,

313
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,520
concepts, etc. The fact that we were not really dependent on Techno, just

314
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,040
the functioning of the architecture. We did not say everything. That is to say that we

315
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,800
still have a few small problems that can arise and that is in the generation of

316
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:03,880
reports. We still encounter a few problems with some customers. The generation

317
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,600
of reports takes a lot of time. These reports are generated by the account, etc.

318
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,080
So there are still optimizations to be made. It should not be forgotten that it is important

319
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,600
to increase beyond the Matomo application, the applications on which Matomo rests,

320
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,400
the timeouts of PHP, Nginx, Proxy, etc. to prevent that when there are generations

321
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:36,880
of reports, in particular the PHP is killed. There are optimizations of the base

322
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,440
of the data to be made. There is the optimization of Quick Tracking. I'm talking about the optimization

323
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:49,920
of Quick Tracking because we had a little trouble getting in charge when we had

324
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,680
a peak at one point. That is to say that the Quick Tracking worked correctly but we did not have

325
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:04,640
a view in the famous real-time. There is a small real-time that allows you to know

326
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:12,120
the number of users who are currently on the platform. In fact, it was still

327
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,520
at 0 and it was because the Quick Tracking was increasing, increasing, increasing, increasing,

328
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,800
until the PHP could no longer take the different loads and send it to the database.

329
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,200
So by optimizing a little bit, we were able to achieve more than 9,000 requests

330
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,400
in the last three minutes. So in the real-time visitor count, you will see,

331
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,760
more than 9,000 users in real time on the platform and for our greatest happiness.

332
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,920
And as our Italian friend said, he was looking at this little real-time count,

333
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
I was the same to check that everything was working correctly.

334
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:56,280
That's it, I'm done. I hope it was instructive. I hope it was, let's say,

335
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:06,320
not too complicated in terms of management concepts, etc. My goal was to see

336
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,240
general concepts to explain to you that finally the Matomo application was

337
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,200
well made enough to scale it and that we had little limit to get

338
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,560
on board with the application. That's it. So now I allow myself to go

339
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:31,720
to the chat to consult the different questions. So Renan who asks us,

340
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,680
should we put the Quick Tracking even on the infrastructure, in case we would have

341
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,240
a traffic peak? Indeed, the Quick Tracking, I recommend it de facto

342
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,400
on any type of installation because it is important to be able to absorb

343
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,120
these small traffic peaks. And if in addition to that we have an application,

344
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:59,560
so if we have our Matomo with our PHP application, how to say,

345
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,520
the Quick Tracking will allow us to avoid overloading the entire machine.

346
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,200
So I think it's important to put it. Knowing that we don't have to put

347
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,600
Redis with the Quick Tracking, even if I think it's not too consumerist to put Redis,

348
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,120
we can use the Quick Tracking in MySQL directly.

349
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,720
Have you had to make some modifications to improve the archiving?

350
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:36,240
So we tried to make some modifications at the infra level to manage the archiving,

351
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:48,880
in particular the limits at the PHP level, etc. And the limits at the level of memory and

352
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,840
the max time. We had cases where the generation took more than an hour,

353
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,200
so we had to optimize that a little bit. And that's one of the ways to improve

354
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,320
that we currently have. I think we really have to try to export

355
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:13,240
the archiving task on something else. I mean, try to make the archiving task

356
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,280
really easy, because it's something that is very consumerist.

357
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,160
Do you have any examples of cost-per-year ratios depending on the number of visits?

358
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,400
No, I don't have that kind of information, I'm sorry.

359
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:33,520
But for an infra that we currently have, for the numbers that I showed you there,

360
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:46,640
we're on five machines, I think. And all of them, let's say, with physical limits,

361
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,000
so flexible CPU RAM. So when we need to increase the load, either we add

362
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,360
a node when it's necessary, or we see that by increasing only the CPU RAM part,

363
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,680
we can absorb the load. Do you have a data system that warns you

364
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,560
when an analyst meets an error page during the report display?

365
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:14,840
Indeed, in this case, we don't want to be alone. So we actually have monitoring

366
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:22,360
on the pages. We use classic tools, like Uptime Robot,

367
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:30,200
PayGearDuty, things like that, that allow us to have errors.

368
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,320
It detects the errors when we make requests. But we also have a system of...

369
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,960
We work, we are very close to our clients, so we work with our clients

370
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:50,280
with chats, etc. So as soon as they have a problem, we are directly

371
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,560
guided by them to try to solve the problem. Knowing that each time,

372
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,080
there are small positive faults. The last time, it was the famous real-time

373
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:06,720
counter that was blocked. The fear was that the tracking queue

374
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,800
didn't work anymore, but the data was in the queue. It's just that

375
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:18,280
Matomo couldn't manage all the data in the database.

376
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,480
Okay. Valentin, can you hear me?

377
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I can hear you very well.

378
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Okay. I'm focusing on this question because sometimes, as a Matomo user,

379
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,480
we often see a message in red that appears in the reports saying that

380
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,480
the server is not powerful enough or that there is an archiving problem.

381
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,080
What I noticed in my clients is that when they encountered this problem,

382
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,680
they weren't questioning Matomo. They were just saying to themselves,

383
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,680
okay, I have to do this request later. They didn't dare to directly

384
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,680
warn the company that manages Matomo. I wanted to know if,

385
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,680
in the monitoring that you talked about a few seconds ago, is it

386
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,680
this type of error message in red that would appear and ping you

387
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,680
and tell you that the person has encountered an error and that it motivates you

388
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,680
to dig and find out how it is possible that they have encountered an error message.

389
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Is it this type of error that has arisen?

390
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,680
No, we don't have too much of this type of error that has arisen,

391
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:28,680
knowing that we regularly check the application logs,

392
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,680
we check the logs of the machine to make sure that we don't have

393
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,680
abnormal errors on the classic execution of the application.

394
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I admit that, for the moment, this kind of problem hasn't arisen too much.

395
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,680
There is a client who has raised this type of problem on a small infra,

396
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,680
but on a particular case, that is to say that the URLs are extremely long.

397
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:57,680
It seems to me that the current limit in Matomo is 1024 characters or 4087,

398
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,680
but the fact that we have a lot of URLs that are very long,

399
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,680
it slows down the archiving a lot and it creates a problem in the interface.

400
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,680
So, here we have customer feedback and that's how we realized that,

401
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,680
for even small infra, sometimes it is necessary to drastically increase the resources

402
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,680
at the PHP level to be able to execute the archiving normally.

403
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Okay, it is currently 9.45, we still have maybe 5 minutes to take a few more questions.

404
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,680
We have a new one that has just arrived in the chat.

405
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:42,680
How do you manage the archiving, do you cut it by segment or year or do you execute it normally?

406
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,680
So, we actually execute it normally, we don't have too many problems with that.

407
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:55,680
The screen that I sent you, the image that I sent you with our results

408
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,680
of more than 130 million actions, etc., it dates from October.

409
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,680
And so, we are going to work with the teams, our customers,

410
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:14,680
to discuss the improvement of archiving on this side.

411
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,680
It's going to be a discussion with them.

412
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,680
But otherwise, we normally execute the archiving.

413
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
That's it.

414
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Great, so I'm looking to see if we still have a few more small questions coming in.

415
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:47,680
So, I see that Alexandra, we are told that it is still in writing, in the chat.

416
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:56,680
So, I take this opportunity to announce the two conferences that will follow right after,

417
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
on the costs of Deezer.

418
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,680
You have one on data visualization.

419
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,680
It's a conference in English, but it's done in French.

420
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,680
So, if some of you are not very comfortable with English,

421
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,680
I don't think it's a problem to follow the conference that's coming.

422
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,680
Otherwise, you have the opportunity to go to a workshop.

423
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,680
In this workshop, the places are limited.

424
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,680
That is to say that it is really the first to arrive, the first to serve.

425
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:31,680
And the workshop, as a reminder, we are based on 25 people who connect.

426
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,680
The workshop is on Implementing Advanced Privacy, Preserving Analytics on Mobile Desktop and Server.

427
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,680
So, probably more a conference that is related to private life.

428
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,680
And so, it will be a feedback on that.

429
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,680
So, it will be by Nathan Freitas.

430
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,680
And so, in room number one, the data visualization part will be with,

431
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,680
precisely, the presentation of a free software called MetaBase,

432
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,680
that maybe some of you know.

433
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,680
And it is presented by Baptiste Stephen, who works at Open Source Politics.

434
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,680
I look one last time if there are any questions in the chat.

435
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,680
Well, yes, we have another question from Alexandra.

436
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,680
Have you encountered errors like MySQL Server has gone away,

437
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,680
so there is an error that often comes up,

438
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,680
during archiving after having invalidated periods?

439
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,680
No.

440
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,680
So, it happened to us, but we increased,

441
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,680
we increased in particular the number of connections at the MySQL server level.

442
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,680
And I do not think we encountered this problem too much.

443
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,680
It seems to me that we were a little spared on this thing.

444
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,680
We had to meet it quickly, but it is not something that shocked me

445
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,680
in the maintenance and management of the infrastructure at the moment.

446
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
Sorry.

447
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Great. But listen, thank you very much, Valentin.

448
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Thank you very much to all of you for choosing this conference.

449
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,680
We now have 12 minutes for a coffee break.

450
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,680
Do not hesitate to interact in the coffee room if you want to discuss with other participants

451
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,680
or go for a real coffee.

452
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,680
Or, and do not forget, you can also go to meet.matomocamp.org

453
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,680
to also interact directly via webcam with other participants.

454
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,680
I give you all an appointment at 10 o'clock for the next conference game.

455
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,680
Thank you all.
