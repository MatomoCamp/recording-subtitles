1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,920
Okay. So it's currently 5 p.m. and that's the end of the first in the history Matamua

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:24,400
camp event. So this last conference will not last 30 minutes, but maybe if we have a lot

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,720
of things to say, it can go up to 30 minutes, but probably I guess that we're going to make

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:39,400
it in 10 minutes. Just probably the simplest word to say is thank you. Thanks for having

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:51,960
it done so far. That was a really dense event. Two full days, many different speakers. Here

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,560
are some KPIs. By the way, feel free to go on chat.matomocamp.org. You have a specific

7
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:07,360
room for this last conference. And I'm closing a ceremony on which you can just say thank

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,160
you or just give feedback about the event. Just a couple of KPIs that we wanted to show

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:23,520
you guys. So we went for two days of talks. Three languages. So we got talk in English.

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,560
Mostly in English. Some in German the first day and some in French in the second and the

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,280
first day. It was mainly English and German. We got 26 conferences in total. For a total

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:49,120
of 26 recordings. Representing at the mid journey of today, those recordings were representing

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:58,000
already more than 10 gigabytes. So I guess the ended result will be close to 15 gigabytes.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,600
We got 24 speakers. We would like to send them once more because I viewed half of the

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,080
conferences and I was really impressed of the level of all of them. Whatever the topic,

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:26,800
whatever the expertise was about, it was really impressive. Up to 1 p.m. we had a number of

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:37,640
804 visits on live.matomocamp.org for the two days. I recently watched back the numbers

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:48,320
and it was around 930 visits on the two days. And let's say optimistic goal forecast for

19
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:56,920
this event was at 1,000 visits. So to say these events went beyond our expectation.

20
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,240
It was really a remarkable event in terms of content brought by the speakers. But as

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,880
well in terms of visitors on the website visits. Even if we don't have, we don't put in place

22
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,280
any system to measure the number of individuals. So I guess the 900 visits that I'm referring

23
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:24,960
to doesn't represent 900 individuals. But I guess we are getting close to these figures.

24
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:32,960
On chat.matomocamp.org, same thing measured here. It was only for the first day and a

25
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,280
half. We got 95 users who make an effort of creating an account on chat.matomocamp.org

26
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:48,680
in order to interact with us, which is a lot. We used another KPI during the pre-event,

27
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,280
which was held one month ago. This was the number of IP connected to the stream. For

28
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:05,000
the pre-event, we got 28 IP connections. And today at 1 p.m., including everything which

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,080
was made the day before, we were up to 385 individual IP connected. Taking into account

30
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:22,240
that we have some people who are coming from the same institution or company. Of course,

31
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,480
those IP does not relate to one individual, but probably in some cases to more than this.

32
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,200
42 is the funny number. In fact, now it came to 43 is the number of unread emails that

33
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,960
we'll have to deal with over the weekend due to the fact that I was fully busy for this

34
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,240
event. I hope that for all the other organizers, it's not that many because 42 means for me

35
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,720
probably one full day of answering all those emails. But that's part of the game when you

36
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:07,600
are part of a big organization such as such as MatomoCamp. In terms of other KPIs, 45

37
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,880
countries were represented during this MatomoCamp. So according to Matomo's data, the

38
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:21,200
attendees were mainly from Germany, then from Sweden, then from France, then from the United

39
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Kingdom, and then the Netherlands. And I'm happy to announce that we got visitors from

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,200
all the continents. As you can see on the maps, of course, mainly Europe, because the

41
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,760
time zone were more convenient for people based in Europe. But we really had all the

42
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,160
nationality which were represented. I was really impressed to see so many flags within

43
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,180
the Matomo system that I looked at some hours ago. So I really would like to thank all the

44
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:59,200
attendees from all over the world. What's next after this event? Well, we're going

45
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,000
to let's say gather all the organizing committees of the MatomoCamp in order to define and

46
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,440
see how they react to the event, what they like, what they dislike. Maybe we will launch

47
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,480
another survey. I don't know. We just need to plan a meeting in order to see, okay, how

48
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,880
did you like it? And after, we will of course see if we want to go for another version of

49
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,280
MatomoCamp. Do we need to think as well about local events? For example, I was really surprised

50
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:42,360
the first day to see a lot of people coming from Nordic countries, Denmark, Norway, Sweden.

51
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,680
So I don't know. There may be some spaces in order to have a MatomoCamp version for

52
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,920
Nordic countries, but as well for Germany, Sweden, as we just saw was a huge part of

53
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,680
the visitors. Maybe France. I don't know. This really depends on, in fact, all the attendees

54
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,360
that we had today, so as the people within the organizing committee to see in which sense

55
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,680
we would like the Matomo community to evolve. But we don't have any plan at the moment.

56
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,280
Just would like to say that if you would like to join the super team that we had the chance

57
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,160
to have this year for this MatomoCamp, please feel free to contact us through matomocamp.org.

58
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Some people informed us that the contact form on our website was not working. It's a bit

59
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,440
more complicated than this, just that you need to push several times on the button.

60
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,680
I had the same feeling this morning when I tested it. I had the feeling that it wasn't

61
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,240
working and then I pressed it twice and then the mail was sent. So, yes, the matomocamp.org

62
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:59,800
contact form is still the way to contact us. If you don't receive an answer by your team,

63
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,960
just send another one and good chance. We are answering to everything except spam, so

64
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,120
you, of course, will receive an answer. If you don't receive it in the proper time, feel

65
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:20,160
free to send another one or try to connect to us through another web by your different

66
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,280
name. The names are the ones that you can see here. So, I really would like to thank

67
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,960
all the members of the organizing team. I really apologize if I miss anyone here. For

68
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,520
example, Marcus Asenberger is probably the one who did the more apologizes because I

69
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,880
forgot to mention him during the opening ceremony. So, thank you, Marcus, for being part of the

70
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Matomo organizing team. Today, Marcus, today and yesterday, Marcus was here in order to

71
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,440
do the moderation of the different conferences. This event could not have been without Lukas

72
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:09,120
Winkler, who is the guy who took on his shoulders a huge amount, an impressive amount of work.

73
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,080
He was here all the time where I could not manage anything anymore because I didn't have

74
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,080
more time, I didn't have more energy, and he's really the guy who is doing kind of everything

75
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:28,920
within MatomoCamp. So, I really would like to thank him. Silva, as well, joined the team

76
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:36,040
during the evolution of the creation of MatomoCamp. She was the one in charge of the moderation

77
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,720
of the different talks, so as all the communication part. I would like to thank, as well, Stéphane

78
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,440
Konig from the Netherlands, Peter Borg, who helped us with all the system administration

79
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,320
and IT infrastructure. Frédéric, as well, was here for the moderation of the talk in

80
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:04,000
French. A huge, huge thanks to Emprunt Digital, to Valentin Bares, who is the one who holds

81
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,280
all the different streams. And thanks to him that we will get the recording of all the

82
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,240
different conferences. I would like to thank, as well, all the digitalists, the AAB team,

83
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,320
and in particular, Thomas Pearson, that some of the attendees have seen many times. I'm

84
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,320
not 100% sure about the number of talks that he made, but I think it's close to five, and

85
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,720
they were all incredible. So, thank you very much, Thomas. I would like to thank, as well,

86
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,240
Stéphane Gill, Thomas Zeithnamerl, and Joachim Neckel for the organizing team. Lukas, am

87
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,360
I missing anyone here within the organizing team?

88
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,200
I can't think of anyone at the moment. Hopefully, I also don't miss anyone.

89
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,080
I would like to thank, again, all the speakers. They were coming from all the different countries.

90
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:08,360
They have made all great and impressive speeches. Of course, Lukas Winkler, Joachim Neckel,

91
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,040
Richard Stark from the InnoCrafts company was making the conference with a time zone

92
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,720
difference of 12 hours from New Zealand, Jorge Powers from the Digitalist AAB team in Sweden,

93
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,160
Thomas Ekman from Germany, Nathan Freitas, Silva Arapi, as well. The Italian team represented

94
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:37,840
by Davide Porovecchio, Pier Luigi Tassi, Claudio Czelligin, Thomas Czernik, Stéphane Konig,

95
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Peter Buhelke, Thomas Pearson, Christian Hallner, Valentin Bares, Baptiste Steven, Victor Vexei

96
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,480
from Hungary, Boris Budini, Frédéric Forster, Aurélie Pauls, Cathy Newbay from the United

97
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,040
Kingdom, and Ronan Elow. Sorry, Lukas, same questions again. Did I

98
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,760
forget anyone here within this list? I hope you didn't.

99
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm sorry for my pronunciation as well. I would like, once more, to thank our sponsors,

100
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:23,880
so Matomo, who, once more, allow us to create and use a logo which is similar to theirs

101
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,320
and as well allow us to use Matomo within our communication support, who as well supported

102
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,840
us in terms of communication. So, probably without their communication impact, we couldn't

103
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,360
have reached you today, or at least some of you guys. So, I would like, once more, to

104
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:51,880
say thank you, Matomo, and of course to provide the world with a free software and a GPL license.

105
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,680
I would like to thank, as well, Empreinte Digital, who, as I said, are the one in charge

106
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,520
of all the streaming parts. I would like to thank, once more, the company of Stefan König,

107
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:11,480
who missed analytics, so as Sonora from Peter Voelker and Stairs from Ligue 1. And many

108
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,920
others, as well, that I would like to thank, who, as I said, many organizers who have been

109
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,320
speakers during this Matomo camp and who have spent a lot of time and energy within this

110
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:32,720
project. And, of course, yes, I can answer shortly. Of course, the one organizer you

111
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,880
forgot to mention is, of course, you, Roland, who initially had the idea to organize a Matomo

112
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:48,120
camp and were the one getting everything started and planning the whole concept from the beginning.

113
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,680
So thanks again for this. Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much. I have to say that I couldn't

114
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,840
have made it without all of you guys and without all, let's say, the IT, free software technology

115
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,640
expertise. I have to say that by myself, even with all the energy that I could brought into

116
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:16,880
it, it's... I just put the energy of someone who wants to create an event and that's it.

117
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,560
Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And, of course, thank you to all of you,

118
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,800
our attendees, because it's always hard to find some time on our working time to come

119
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,960
and assist all those conferences. Thank you for all your kindness because we didn't have

120
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,360
any trolling experience on the social networks. You have been all nice to each other through

121
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,440
the chat. You played the game. You accepted to post some questions on chat.matomo.org.

122
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,520
You sent some questions. And to the question that most of you will probably ask are where

123
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:01,720
the materials are of the speakers and where the recording of the talks are. Well, the

124
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,120
recording of the talks, correct me if I'm wrong, Lukas, but they will be posted on the

125
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,000
URL named videos.matomocamp.org within the coming days, am I right?

126
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,520
Yeah, we will set up the video platform in the next days and editing all the recordings,

127
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,760
of course, will take some time and we will just go on and publish them once they're ready.

128
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,960
So if you follow us on the social media accounts or if you look on the video platform every

129
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,520
few days, you will be notified whenever a new recording is published.

130
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:44,280
So yeah, if you just refresh matomocamp.org webpage from time to time, if you follow us

131
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,000
on the social network, good chances that we will announce at some point that the videos

132
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,080
are live. You can already find one, which is the one about the pre-matomo camp event.

133
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:05,800
And if you have some time, I invite you to break meet.matomocamp.org, which is the based

134
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,320
on work adventure, which is a social place on which you can move and meet the different

135
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,520
people who are connected on the platform and then interact with them in real time in video

136
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
and webcam.

137
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,400
And I'm going to go there in something like two minutes once I finish this slide. And

138
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,080
I really hope that I will have the opportunity to meet some of you guys there and to connect

139
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:37,040
a little bit more like if we were in a physical presence. Lukas, Valentin, do you have any

140
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,040
any things left that you would like to say before we close officially the event?

141
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,640
Nothing major for me. Just thanks everyone for making this event possible and such a

142
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,480
huge success as it was.

143
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,640
Same for me. Just thank you for your time. All of your speakers and Lukas, especially.

144
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:04,880
