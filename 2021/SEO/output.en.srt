1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,520
Yes, wonderful. I would have simply said, we are starting now, yes, from my side

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,440
also first of all welcome to Matomo Camp. This is the first Matomo Camp that we

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,440
also organize and I have, in addition to the fact that Lukas has organized almost everything, of course

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,600
, the honor of holding my own lecture here. We have decided in advance

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,280
that we also want to record this workshop. This should mean, for example, if you have

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,280
a video on or if you decide to say something or say something,

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,400
then that is not forbidden. But you should just think that we record it.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,800
We actually planned it in such a way that we, so to speak, I now do the presentation

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,680
first. We just put the questions back a bit. We now have the advantage in this

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,680
workshop that we have the time until, so to speak, 11.45 a.m. and that there is now also the

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,120
lunch break afterwards. That means that if we can then ask questions afterwards,

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,040
then that is not so problematic, because you would not miss any other sessions and so on

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,440
. Maybe you would lose a little one or two minutes of the lunch break or something.

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,760
So that's why, as I said, welcome again from my side at this point.

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,120
My lecture today is just how to use Matomo correctly for SEO. That means, how can I

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,280
combine these two systems or how can I best combine them together to

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,000
get numbers out of Matomo that are very helpful for the search engine optimization.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,920
And briefly to my person, my name is Thomas Zeithammel. I have actually been working in online

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,960
marketing in the field of SEO since 2001. At that time we did not even know that it was called SEO.

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,360
I have been there for so long, an old rabbit. I have already been through a lot and have

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,840
various customers from different areas, which of course also come from Google Analytics

22
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,480
and have also already worked with Matomo. And since 2009, simply out of private interest,

23
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,680
with my own websites, I looked around for software and at that time

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,440
I became aware of Pepeg. And yes, I have been familiar with the system for 12 years now,

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,080
give training, offer consulting and so on. And I would like to talk about the topic today,

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,920
what we can really combine in SEO and Matomo. The most important thing for me is

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,720
actually to really interpret the numbers correctly. And it is the case that we first of all

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,000
pick up a lot of numbers that we are actually more or less interested in.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
So a value such as IP address, website title, for example the screen resolution,

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,080
with which language the browser works and so on. All these values are all

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,640
investigated and collected via the data layer or whatever, whether with a tech manager or whatever.

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,000
We now have all these dimensions on board in Matomo and can then of course

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,480
evaluate them. The question is, can I start something with the IP address,

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,240
which is anonymized, can I use it for SEO? Not really. That means I have to pick out here

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,480
which numbers are particularly important for SEO. And there I just picked out 10

36
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,520
where I said that is really something where you should always keep an eye on it.

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,440
On the one hand, of course, the search terms that you, for example, got from Google

38
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,800
and so on. In the end, the search terms are unfortunately no longer completely visible,

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,560
but there is a way in which I will then help you to unravel these search terms again.

40
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
The second is a very important number, for example the period of time. This is also underestimated very,

41
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,440
very often. But for SEO it is of course very, very important to see if I can do it with

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,720
my content, with my page, in the end, to keep the visitors on my page for a long time.

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,440
And that results again with the jump rate. If I see that, oh, it's very high.

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,600
That also means again for Google, of course, I may have a return to search

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,880
quota, a very high one, which sends a signal to Google that perhaps the content is not so good

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,520
or does not fit the search phrase. So that can also be important for SEO, so to speak,

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,920
and we have that here in the system. Webvitals, of course, the classic now of the last six,

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,240
seven months. Everyone who deals with SEO is just talking about these terms,

49
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
such as webvitals and the topic performance loading time. That has been very high in the last two,

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,320
three years, which of course also gives Matomo a very, very good plug-in

51
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,160
or opportunities to raise these numbers. Entry pages, classic, yes, certainly,

52
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,040
very, very important for the field of SEO, as well as the visitor sources. So not to see

53
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,520
where the visitors really come from, not just to focus on the zoom machine,

54
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,440
but perhaps also to look at the references. Technical aspects. Where do I have maybe 404

55
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,240
errors on my page? Where are there server errors? It may also be that this can of course be determined

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,960
by tracking or, in the end, by crawling tools. But here I have the

57
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,480
opportunity to say right away, wait a minute, so many have really called up. Of course,

58
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,280
such a dead link is always bad, but if I see in the web analysis that it has

59
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,800
never been called up in any way, then it's not that bad either. Then I don't have to

60
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,200
worry too much about it. While I, when I see that in another statistic, that a page

61
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,960
that sends 404 has been called up a few times, maybe even a day, then I have to react faster

62
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,240
and can also evaluate the internal search. Very important for the editorial team,

63
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,080
for example. Also this number, whether an article has been read or not,

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,240
I can somehow summarize in Matomo or have it issued. And of course the whole

65
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,400
topic of conversion tracking. These are the most important numbers that you will certainly have

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,400
in the SEO as points of contact with Matomo. I'm going to take out a few things now,

67
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,440
such as the delay and the delay. Because that has always been the topic of Google in recent years,

68
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,120
although they introduced a panda update back then in 2012, so it's been a little longer again.

69
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,440
But what happened is that the delay and the jump rate of Google can also be

70
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,680
raised. So Google has this data available and can integrate it into their user signals

71
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,960
and let these user signals flow into their algorithm. And you just need a few

72
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,040
points that you have to consider here in these two numbers, delay and jump rate.

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,400
And there I just set up six points that make it a little easier for me to

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,400
explain the connections. On the one hand, if I have a jump rate of 100 percent, then in Matomo

75
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,520
there is also a value of 0.0 seconds for these pages. That means if there is a jump rate,

76
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,480
so a jump is sent, then I don't have any delay in this session.

77
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,080
This is related to how the delay is calculated. And here it is the case that the last page,

78
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,040
i.e. the exit page, is not included in the visit as time. That means I always have

79
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,240
the last page of the visit with a value of 0.000 seconds delay. So unfortunately the exit page

80
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,720
always sends no signals as to how long you have been on this page. Because in Matomo, like other

81
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,760
systems, so also like Google Analytics, the distance between page 1 call and page

82
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,640
2 call is always counted together. And just as in the delay, with the jump rate,

83
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,360
then I have the entry page, then the exit page. This is how the jump rate is defined.

84
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,560
And then of course, because the exit page has no value, I have this value of zero here.

85
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,920
That means you have to understand these two metrics first of all, why sometimes

86
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,160
the exact value is not in there that you might expect. But of course you don't always have

87
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,040
a jump rate of 100%, but just less. And then of course there are users

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,880
who also send values here. So high jump rates are always a recommendation of mine

89
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,160
to take a look at such pages in the page analysis and say, wow, there may be

90
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,360
technical errors. We already had cases where a consent banner was delivered over the page,

91
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,200
but they were not so well integrated on the mobile device that the people simply

92
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
couldn't click these buttons anymore. So there was no way to accept, because it was too far

93
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,800
to the right outside of the screen and you couldn't scroll. And then of course we see,

94
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,760
ha, wobala, in the mobile area the jump rate is very, very high and not so high in the desktop area.

95
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,880
So you can also detect and detect errors. So such a high jump rate can

96
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,560
definitely be looked at. But a high jump rate does not mean that the page is

97
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,920
very, very bad, but a high jump rate in connection with a period of time

98
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,440
makes sense. Because the period of time is very high, I don't really care about the jump rate

99
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,120
in the end. Because it can also mean that the user has come to the page,

100
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,200
has been busy with the content for a long time, has read it completely and was then simply

101
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,480
more satisfied and then left the page because of that. Not because he was dissatisfied.

102
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,960
So that means just going to the jump rate is not so ideal here. The same is true

103
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,480
if I have a high period of time and a low jump rate, that is also a positive

104
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,680
value actually. Because the users have read the article, that's why this high period of time

105
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,840
and went on. I can see that from the fact that the jump rate is then just low. That

106
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,760
means I was able to keep the visitors on the page and maybe

107
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,200
navigate them better through the website through similar articles in e-commerce or through related topics

108
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,640
again on a news page or something. Or I have blog posts that I wrote about

109
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,120
and they are also interesting for the reader. So that is of course something that is very, very good,

110
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,760
which is actually the ideal step 5 here or this point 5. But of course there is also a

111
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,560
low period of time and a very high jump rate. That is always such a sign that you

112
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,760
may have been dissatisfied as a user. So, in general, you can't say that either. Just think of

113
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,160
the industry books. Industry books, I'll give you one, Dachdecker, Augsburg, I'll get to a page,

114
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,600
I'll quickly write down the phone number, I'll be on the page again. That means I don't spend

115
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,640
much time reading the content or something, but I just need to

116
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,720
contact you somehow quickly. I'll get the information out of it very briefly,

117
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,560
have seen everything. Also, if I enter which pre-election number the 0421 belongs to or something,

118
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,280
then I just give it to pre-election 0421. Then I come to a page, look at me, ah,

119
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,840
that's the one and the city, then I'm gone again. So please don't

120
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,400
always be so partial. And just when you say that, yes, I have to understand the characteristics,

121
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,720
then please also understand that detractors always play a big role here. I have

122
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,040
set up such a small screen at the bottom, where you can see that these average values,

123
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,760
which are unfortunately excluded in Matomo, which cannot influence either, that they can of course

124
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,120
also be influenced by certain pages. At the bottom of the screen, so I have different

125
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,000
pages, page 1, 2, 3 and so on, and this page 5 is so popular. If page 5 now has a super

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,160
deflection rate of maybe only 20 percent, but all the other pages are with a

127
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,960
deflection rate of 80 percent or something, then my average value, because the one page

128
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:15,320
here, the 5, is so good, would give me a little bit of a good feeling that the

129
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,360
deflection rate here is not a problem at all in this domain. So that means that these

130
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,520
statistic values ​​please always look at each other separately, really go into the data

131
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:31,320
, really break down and take a deeper look. So in the average values is often

132
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,960
simply something covered up, which you can see more when you go into the details. Especially when you

133
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,720
have pages that dominate very, very much. These can be, for example, pages like the starting page,

134
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,920
which of course always serves as an entry for many pages in the e-commerce area, which then

135
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,720
always sends positive signals, but maybe the product details at the back send all bad

136
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,840
signals. Then I should just look at them separately from each other. And of course the

137
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,120
segments help me very, very well. So in Matomo I have the opportunity to create these segments

138
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,640
among all these visitors. The problem is that they are more or less not given by Matomo,

139
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,480
but that I have to create them myself. That is always the first thing I do when I

140
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,360
go to a website with a customer or so on, to create these segments here so that the

141
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,600
users can then also compare these segments, i.e. the customers. And there I always recommend

142
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,120
at least to divide the channels so that I really have the channel direct, the channel campaigns,

143
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,560
the channel search engines, the channel maybe also references and also the desktop or mobile types,

144
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,520
i.e. what is available to us as a device type as a dimension in Matomo. Then I can

145
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,960
compare how the user behaves in mobile versus the user in the desktop area. Or just

146
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,760
make the comparison of how people who come from search engines behave versus people who,

147
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,640
for example, come via Google Ads, via campaigns or via direct entries. Because they

148
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,080
behave completely differently. And I would like to identify more precisely in the SEO,

149
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,560
how it is and how it works, for example. And then these values, such as exit rates or

150
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,040
or departure rates or also for a while, or side views and so on,

151
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,440
these will become much clearer. That first of all to pre-tension, yes, to understand that

152
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,240
these values ​​also have to be interpreted correctly. Otherwise it won't help me for my SEO

153
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,400
in the end. The second thing I would like to address is the data collection.

154
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,040
It should mean how I can simply evaluate or improve the values ​​that I measure.

155
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,040
And here the classic, the events. I still have the case very often that events have

156
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,200
not yet been set up. And now with the Tag Manager, for example, it is so easy to

157
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,760
set up these events. Of course, you need a bit of knowledge, perhaps from the HTML,

158
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,640
to recognize that this is the CSS class, the button is called ID and so on. Or here is the

159
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,920
link text. What is a link text? Of course, you do need a bit of foresight, but it is a

160
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,400
very nice opportunity to transfer these events, what happens on the page,

161
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:24,120
and so on, to Matomo. And with that the data will be better again. And then maybe

162
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,600
set up as goals. And there you can also distinguish two topics. On the one hand, my technical

163
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,680
problems that I may have on the page. That means I solve events if, for example,

164
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,400
a page of errors arises or is called up. Zack, same event,

165
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,720
Amatomo, Zack, page 404. The same also with a 500 error, if my server is not currently

166
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,280
reachable or something and I still deliver the error message or the error page,

167
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,960
or if the URL was just built up like that because someone from the forum has mistakenly linked it to our

168
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,960
website. Then I can also send these errors to the web analyzer right away.

169
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,040
And the same, of course, also on the page level, if I have certain topics there. For example,

170
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,800
if I notice that an article has been sold out. Here, Zack, please send to Matomo right away. Because I can

171
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,920
then make evaluations about it later and can say how many people have run into articles. I have

172
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,240
1000 visitors. And of the 1000 visitors, how many have run into articles that were really

173
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,960
sold out? What do I do with it? Do I let them run like that? Because they might come back.

174
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,680
So I can then think about my viewing measures more carefully. Or the

175
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,080
no search results. I also had an e-commerce shop myself and there I also found out

176
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,040
in the search what people enter. There is also this Google zeitgeist, where at the end of the year

177
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,960
always comes out what people are looking for wrong with Google, i.e. where the writing is wrong. There is

178
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,560
a word like couch, for example, always in the top ten, where I think to myself, oh, couch is

179
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,200
actually not that difficult. But that is one of the most common wrongly written words. If you

180
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,480
are now a furniture seller and then also notice, wait a minute, people enter couch

181
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,080
wrongly written and I have no search results, then this event can help you

182
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,200
point out that somehow these hits are not there. It is also very often simply not

183
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,760
set up. And I just went from bottom to top a bit, the page read topic.

184
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,440
So that is also something that you can then set up something similar to scroll depth very, very nicely

185
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,880
via the tag manager. Of course also manually. But in the end it's really about

186
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,360
really taking something like a scroll depth in here. We have the case very often,

187
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:48,080
you have a page, the people are on it, you have a period of time, but you actually don't know

188
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,480
when such an article will be finished. And that's what this content tracking format

189
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,000
is very valuable for. Because with it, for example, I have such blocks that are close to the footer,

190
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,480
you can also do it directly over the footer. But if I have such elements

191
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,200
above the footer, such as these social bookmarks or share links or something, then I can

192
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,720
just say that if that appears in the area of ​​the visible in the browser, then it has

193
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,000
dealt intensively with such an article somewhere and read through it. There are very few people

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,720
who really scroll down completely at the end, go up again and then start reading.

195
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,200
But the people already proceed in such a way that they scroll down one or two times, but do not scroll down the whole

196
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,680
article. And so I can see a little bit when I say when the footer is

197
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,920
displayed, then I know, ah okay, this article has at least been read. These two

198
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:50,200
numbers, pages, views and pages read, I'll call them pages read, I can then

199
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,040
see again in direct relation and say, okay, then I really have a problem here at this point

200
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,000
because I have a thousand views on the page, less than 20 at some point

201
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,760
have seen the footer. So I can grab these numbers a little better again and

202
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,000
especially then also locate in my editorial office and say, now look here,

203
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,800
we just have a more accurate evaluation now. And this scroll depth can be used in the

204
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,720
tag manager then also by percentage, which is of course much more

205
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:28,520
convincing. And of course please use your own dimensions, because that is

206
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,840
the most valuable thing that I can actually integrate into the evaluations. I can

207
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,960
take something like the release date, for example, or just the article type with

208
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,080
article type or also page types, I mean, is it a product part page, is it an overview,

209
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,880
is it the start page, is it the search page, are there topic pages, text pages, whatever,

210
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,520
I can transfer what I want. And these own dimensions are just

211
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,800
super suitable for this, as well as to include product categories and say, this is the

212
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:06,080
overridden product category, for example, this is food, this is fashion, this is that,

213
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,640
because later on in my conversions, for example, I can also divide it up more precisely,

214
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,200
or I can just say, aha, okay, our conversion in the field, for example, fashion is higher

215
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,920
than the conversion in the field of food or something, yes, or in other topics. You have

216
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,680
comparability through this. You can also include indexing, if you say you have

217
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,200
many pages on noindex, that is, these are pages that are excluded for Google,

218
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,560
but are still on the website, yes, I'm thinking, for example, of certain categories,

219
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,400
page pages and so on. Then I can also transfer these indexing values to Matomo and say,

220
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,880
okay, here, then I can see how much traffic I still have on my noindex page.

221
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Then I can possibly think, oh, maybe with a little text enrichment I can

222
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,440
still put it from noindex to index, or, or, or. These are the points that you can

223
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,640
easily deduce. Or just the number of words, yes, that just makes sense in rounds,

224
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,200
so 50 or 100 words in rounds, but then you can see how the duration also behaves,

225
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,640
how the deviation rates also behave. And where I can see exactly, with all texts

226
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,680
that were below 100 words, the deviation rate was just very, very high, or just very low,

227
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,080
because maybe the information I have is already enough. So to transfer these values to Matomo,

228
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,880
also structured data, yes, filter, yes, if I have a shop, that also makes sense

229
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,720
to transfer to Matomo. Because to take everything in again and think about how

230
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,960
I can deduce measures and proportions from my numbers, that is what is

231
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,480
important for you in the end and then, to make decisions. What do we do with it?

232
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,040
Do we link this category more often? Do we put more text on it? Do we look at

233
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,840
technical problems? How do we get this done? Quite classic now maybe the loading time optimization,

234
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,320
if I just know that, for example, on the article type product page, the deviation rates are

235
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,600
higher and the delay is lower, then I can just see how the measurement data for the

236
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,600
WebVitals are. And if they are significantly worse than on the overview pages, then I can go there,

237
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,040
then I go there first and optimize there. So I can use the segments, the dimensions,

238
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,000
I can also use the segments, just get in here much, much better and check it out.

239
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,040
And also this search term is not defined, which means what the visitors came up with

240
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,440
on Google. Yes, Google was blocked back then, they said in 2014, because of the NSA affair,

241
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,040
because of our HTTPS encryption, we no longer transfer these search terms. But

242
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,320
the funny thing is, there is the Google Search Console that offers this data again. And here

243
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,880
there is a very simple plug-in from Matomo, although it is mandatory, but that is really one of the

244
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,040
must-have plug-ins that I need for the SEO area, because that brings me back these data

245
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,080
into Matomo. And that's the nice thing, because I have my segments here, I have everything

246
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,240
in the area of ​​conversions and so on running together. That means in the Google Search Console you can

247
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,920
also say, yes, I have the data there. But because I connect it to Matomo, it does

248
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,920
that much better, because then I can also see which conversions are responsible for which keywords,

249
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,360
for example. So this combination of this data again with my dimensions,

250
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,560
with my segments, with mobile versus desktop and all these topics, I can now

251
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,000
evaluate them much better here in Matomo and sort them out. That means

252
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,800
all the filter functions, everything I have associated with it, is just much, much better

253
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,160
for me. So for me a must-have. But you can also look at the functionality. I

254
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,000
also included it as a link at the bottom. You are welcome to go to the Matomo Cloud, there is a demo version

255
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,800
where this plug-in is also installed. Then you can see, aha, is there anything suitable for me or not.

256
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:06,840
That means you can definitely take a look at that. That's as far as what I should definitely

257
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,160
mention in terms of data points, i.e. events, content tracking and of course these search terms

258
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,560
and dimensions. These are the four topics that in any case, if you don't have that yet and

259
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,720
really want to evaluate it better in SEO, then you need these four measuring points

260
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:31,600
in addition. And now just a few more tips, so to speak, on improvement. And it's

261
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,040
about me just explaining a few things to you again, what you can do or how you

262
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,880
could really approach that. So in the field of SEO you are always looking for

263
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,640
these topics. So I already mentioned earlier, yes, especially this Panda update or

264
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,320
other updates that always target the same thing, namely where I have

265
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,960
thin content on my domain, bad content, little text, maybe and so on and so forth.

266
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,200
There are a lot of really cool SEO tools that can help there too, but the most important

267
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,840
metrics for these recognitions are always rather to be found in Matomo or in the web analysis.

268
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,080
And there you just have to look at two real values. I've already said that one

269
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,680
is in the end the jump rate. Please note here that this jump rate always refers to

270
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,160
the entries and not to the side views. This means that this 90 percent does not refer here

271
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,880
in the first line to this 31, but you really have to jump into the table where

272
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,520
the entries are also included. But that tells me here now, 90 percent of all people

273
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,520
who have arrived at this bottom page or even these 97 percent of these users who have arrived

274
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,520
here on the page, 97 percent of them are gone again, so really very, very many.

275
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,200
I can definitely take a look at that, but also in relation to the pass rate.

276
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,840
There I only see one second, so all the people jumped off and there was only one second

277
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:13,240
on it and there only three seconds. So in general there is a very, very low pass rate on the page,

278
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:20,320
which means that I can take a look at all of these pages. And then you often come up with

279
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,080
this problem of the jump rate that refers to the entry pages. You have to jump back and forth a bit

280
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,320
and also jump back and forth to the entry pages here in order to

281
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,560
show this jump rate in more detail. So here I also have 34 entries and

282
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:44,000
also 34 jumps, so 100 percent. So it does not refer to 90 or 100 page views,

283
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,600
but really only to these entries. And then you will find pages like this, for example

284
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,280
here on the example of the yellow pages where I have entered something, Matomo under Meitingen. Then

285
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,880
down here, dear users, there is unfortunately no hit in this radius for your search term. I have

286
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,800
a radius of 50 kilometers here, so I am the only one in 50 kilometers who seems to be dealing with the topic

287
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:12,000
and still have not been introduced. Of course, this is a very bad experience for users.

288
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,280
You will not say, okay, I'll stay on this page for five minutes now and take a

289
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:23,000
closer look at everything again, but either, of course, I enter something else at the top or

290
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,040
I turn my back on the page and then immediately go away and look for the second result.

291
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,960
So search in search is always difficult anyway, people usually go back to Google.

292
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,440
Or there are also pages where I notice that the button for buying is faded out, this product

293
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,440
may no longer exist. Yes, then of course I am quickly away from this page, because I

294
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,680
might have wanted to buy this now and it just doesn't exist anymore. Then I go back

295
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:57,000
and maybe look for someone else. Especially with Amazon it is the page, for example, buying PS5,

296
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,800
which is causing quite a bit of despair, because of course there is no PS5 to buy.

297
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,160
And you keep coming back to the page, but you see that I can't buy it at all,

298
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,880
then everyone is gone. And they don't read much more, because they were

299
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,480
already there five or six times. That's why for this page they also have a bad

300
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:20,320
jump rate and a low pass rate, that always pulls everything down a bit. Just

301
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,680
as a practical example. And now my tips on how to interpret these numbers correctly.

302
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:34,000
You have this little gear symbol when you scroll down within this evaluation page,

303
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,440
where you don't have these data in this grouping where they have the folder structure at the front,

304
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,760
in this hierarchical order, but you can also display these data flatly.

305
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,280
I always find that nicer, because then you can sort it out nicely with this flat representation,

306
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,480
where all web addresses are really listed on top of each other, without, pardon me,

307
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,760
groups. And then you can just say, for example, I sort after a

308
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:05,720
pass rate, I sort after a jump rate. So the clarity is just much, much better here.

309
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,480
A note, of course, that you always had to look at it differently from case to case.

310
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,320
That means that what I'm giving you here as tips is not entangled in stone,

311
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,040
because again, the industry books have different conditions, so it's different there.

312
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:26,520
The same goes for other pages, types, it always depends on it. But if you just want to say,

313
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,440
and I want to do that here, because I have very good experience in the field of SEO,

314
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,000
which pages should you look at, then everything that is over 70% in the jump rate,

315
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,080
yes, don't just throw it away blindly and say, oh, that's probably all crap,

316
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,360
but definitely look at it more closely. And just look at it, if I have 70% and higher,

317
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,720
where is the delay perhaps under 15 seconds? Why 15 seconds? Such a page always needs

318
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,560
time until it is there, until you orientate a bit. The structure is always top left, the logo

319
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,120
at the top right, maybe the goods basket. If you have a large navigation at the top, a search field,

320
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
then somehow there might be a text again. I don't even know yet, I have to

321
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,960
find my way around a bit. If it's a product overview page, then I scroll through it first

322
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,480
and look, ah, these are products that are exhausting me. That means this time to find my way around

323
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,640
at all, without me starting and reading text or thinking about it,

324
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:33,120
I always need between 7 and 10 seconds. That's why everything that is under 15 seconds was a

325
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,320
quick decision that doesn't fit for me. Let me just differentiate again. Of course,

326
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,920
if you only have a photo series with one picture on it, then that's faster than 15 seconds,

327
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,360
which of course doesn't mean, yes, always on your own, on your own body,

328
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,960
maybe play through it, make a fool of yourself, go to the page, say, okay, how long do I need

329
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,600
now, if I would now deal with this page for the first time. And these pages

330
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,080
also scroll up so much that you always have at least 50 pages of impressions or more.

331
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,200
So that means you can control that via the date at the top, that you say, yes, I don't just want

332
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,560
one day now, but the week, or if the week doesn't work out, then rather a month,

333
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,960
because of the statistics, I can't just make better equipment. The

334
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,000
Heinzberg study back then with Corona, yes, where they tested 500 and I think 700 people there,

335
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,240
said, well, that's how it has to be with 82 million Germans, I don't think anything of it as a statistician.

336
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,240
So then rather say, I just need more values, with more values I have a more reasonable

337
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,120
statement of strength, which brings these topics together, like delay and drop rate. And

338
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,240
through more data, I also smooth out these average values. Because so outliers that were then once a day

339
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,320
or something, I just smooth them out with it and through more data. And these pages,

340
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,880
as I said, please take a look in the browser to be able to understand the behavior,

341
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,440
to see, was that understandable, so why, okay, the users got the information here

342
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,920
, if they wanted to, then here is a drop rate, a high drop rate, not at all

343
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:17,560
surprising, yes. Yes, tip number two was already a topic earlier, so of course the

344
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,240
internet search is often not taken care of. You actually have to enter these parameters

345
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,520
at the bottom of many systems only under manage settings, which you then also use for the search yourself

346
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,960
. Or then maybe also send this information via Javascript,

347
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,000
also in the tech manager, please set it up, that is often the case, even if it is not present in the system

348
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,480
or something, you can also do it relatively easily, because it just brings a lot of great results

349
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,080
for your own evaluation. On the one hand, the top searches always give hints on what

350
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,320
are the topics in question. And people always search when the pages are not so easy to reach for

351
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,760
them, because they say, oh, the menu control is very complex or hoppala, I don't know

352
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,000
exactly how I get there, is that now in this category or there, there may be no

353
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,720
brand overviews, I know, but I'm looking for the product of the brand, so they are very, very

354
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,680
fast because they just say, oh, that seems very complex to me and I want to get to my goal

355
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:25,200
very quickly, that's why this search is also used. Normally, in the field of e-commerce or

356
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,280
other areas, 5 to 15 percent is now on average. Of course, that can also differ

357
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,720
from page to page and of course it also depends on the integration. Something like the yellow pages or other

358
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,560
industry publishers, yes, they have a focus on the fact that people are also looking there, that the

359
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,560
search is very prominent. Think of Amazon too, the search field is very prominent up there

360
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:51,360
, no one is hanging around because of these 40,000 categories that Amazon offers there.

361
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,920
But it is always a good indication of what people are really looking for. Please also pay attention to

362
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,680
large and small writing points here. We also have that very often, for example, that jackets

363
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,120
in large writing and jackets in small writing have two numbers in this statistic.

364
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,920
That makes it more difficult to evaluate again and also discover many new editorial topics,

365
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:18,960
write mistakes, I already mentioned that earlier, and also measure these zero hit results.

366
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,520
You can either see that in this search overview here or you send it out

367
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,160
as I suggested earlier. Tip number three, which pages should I

368
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,480
optimize? I say that very often because that is also an important aspect in SEO.

369
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:43,840
Yes, our shop may have 50,000 products. I can't optimize 50,000 products. No, but I

370
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,640
have the product sales data in Matomo. I know exactly how many purchases or how many

371
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,920
purchases have been made about it and what amount was also in the warehouse. So I have this information.

372
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,760
I just called it here small 1 to small 10 and counted some numbers with it.

373
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,400
But what I see again and again in the evaluations is that if I pull out the top 25 products here

374
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,760
and therefore this segment product pages and so on and also in the e-commerce area these

375
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:19,240
product SKUs and so on, then I immediately see which 25 products make the most

376
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:26,360
sales for me. And I have pages that make up 70 percent, the average is then more like 30 percent,

377
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:33,000
but of course these are the pages that I should optimize. That means I go through the top 25 here

378
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,760
and look at page 2, page 3, page 4. What can I do much better on these pages?

379
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,760
That's just, the effort can then scale. When I have the 25 products ready, I go to the

380
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,120
next ones. So I don't go and say 50,000, we need 50,000 new product texts now,

381
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:57,360
but first I need 25 new product texts. And if they work and if they work to some extent,

382
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,600
then I go to the next ones. But first of all, I always take out the most profitable names

383
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,440
and optimize them. Because the probability that I now have a product at the bottom that

384
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,480
is perhaps a storekeeper, that I make a bestseller out of it, is rather low. So look there,

385
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,400
what is in the internal search, is also searched often. You can

386
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,840
put these numbers nicely together and say, okay, it is searched often, these are one of our

387
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,800
most popular categories, I can see that from the page evaluation and I go to these products.

388
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:36,240
Tip number 4 is the visitor flow. We already have this transition in Matomo,

389
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,880
where you can see what are the predecessors and successors, more about that in a moment,

390
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,880
but there is also a very nice plug-in that is unfortunately also free of charge,

391
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,000
but also saves me work. That's why I'm always such a friend of such plug-ins,

392
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,600
which then save me a lot of work, where I don't sit in the evaluation for four hours,

393
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,080
but have understood in two minutes what is going on. For me it is always an argument

394
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,840
why you can say, okay, then I really go there. And as I said, I have good connections

395
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,240
for Matomo, but I also had to buy these plug-ins, but I also use them

396
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,520
often. And this user flow is a complete view of the entire domain, how the visitors

397
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,680
behave on my site now. And there I also see patterns again and again, that, for example,

398
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,200
people who go through the site and at the end of the visit, for whatever reason,

399
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,880
they go back to the start page, for example. So now I can think about where I want my

400
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,320
users to go and integrate that into this whole workflow. This

401
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,080
behavior flow. I have a few metrics in my hand right now that I have now simply visually

402
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,480
prepared better. On the one hand, I see dikes on the basis of my jump rates, which are

403
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,080
these red bars, where I simply lose visitors massively. If I already lose a lot of visitors

404
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,200
on the first page, then there is simply little left out of the back that then navigates

405
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,840
further through the page. What I can also do is show these details to me,

406
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:12,360
what kind of pages are in there, for example, and how many exits or further leading

407
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,200
visitors there are. That means I can really navigate through here in detail

408
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:26,240
and look at these paths and analyze them. That means looking at the top paths,

409
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,600
where the visitors go further and what they do there. That is very, very nice about this module

410
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:41,680
and very quickly and beautifully visualized by this plugin. I also have such evaluations

411
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,200
under it, where I immediately see this top path, where I see that the people who

412
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,440
all somehow get on the website analysis and then go back to the website

413
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,440
analysis. They just press F5 or take something through at some point. Or that the people

414
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,320
arrive at my web analysis page and then go to the start page. So I see

415
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,640
such elements now. As I said, my page is not that prominent now. I now

416
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,840
put relatively little focus on it, but it's not the best page either, I have to admit.

417
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,960
But of course it is also important for me when I say how my services are,

418
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,800
how things are. With a larger page, of course, it is much more interesting. Do I get the people

419
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,480
there? When do they start looking for it? And you can see that very nicely in these

420
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:38,280
top navigations. And of course also here, which is very nicely depicted in this user flow,

421
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,640
but I often want to take a deeper look at it, these transitions are then

422
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,200
under behavior. This is both in the menu as well as if you have the pages

423
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,400
displayed flat or if you are here on the URL level. So I only call it blue links.

424
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,480
Yes, then you have it available right when you drive over this field with the mouse.

425
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,560
That's just this nice butterfly graphic that just tells me where the people

426
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,000
came from on the clicked page. So I see here, I have 256 page impressions,

427
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,840
of which 50 came from internal and so on and so forth. Yes, and 195 from search engines.

428
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:24,480
So these are the predecessors of the internal pages. And I see, and that's just what is

429
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:32,360
next. What is it, so to speak, what happens next? Where are you going? And here just for a page

430
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,960
that has to do with crafts. And so I immediately see if someone was on the craftsman's side,

431
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,760
where is he going? And I can already see hoppala, these are just building instructions, very popular.

432
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,640
So if I go over this page, then people want to jump into these building instructions.

433
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,800
So, and now we come to SEO aspects where I just say, that's why it makes no sense to present a

434
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,120
fly-out menu on many pages. Better a menu where I can see where I am right now and where

435
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,400
I am right now. This is again and again where I have to discuss this with many customers,

436
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,360
because someone who is in ladies' fashion does not buy a furniture cabinet wall now.

437
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:16,680
He doesn't. But he is in his ladies' world or she is in his ladies' world and looks at things there.

438
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:24,200
If I'm wearing evening dresses, they bring you to the left, maybe blouses or jackets,

439
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,240
even further. But they don't jump back and forth like that. You can see that very well with Zalando.

440
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,280
They have three theme worlds at the top, ladies, gentlemen and children. And if you go into gentlemen,

441
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,640
then you no longer see a menu. You have no way of getting to the ladies' skirt,

442
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,360
which doesn't make any sense at all. And you can do that here, if you show this statistic.

443
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:50,320
First make it really clear to many. Look, you have so much, you have 200 links on the page,

444
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:57,400
but the relevant ones are these top 5, for example. And these are all themes near pages.

445
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,360
That means that no one clicks across somehow and the reach of the menu does not have to go down

446
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,160
to every third level so that I have 600 links at the top of the menu because I have such a large

447
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,600
product range. Or in the news publisher of the newspaper publisher, who then says,

448
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,360
yes, we have 84 places in the region and of course they should all be reachable. Yes,

449
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:24,400
but if the places are then really far apart in the region and you just say,

450
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,640
yes, here from north to south it is somehow 180 kilometers, then no one looks at that anymore.

451
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,480
So whoever is sitting at the very bottom doesn't look at the content at the top anymore, geographically speaking.

452
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,880
So please always evaluate that. Unfortunately, only these top 5 here, I think that's a bit of a shame.

453
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,280
I would also like, maybe for Lukas, you can, you can also listen, hopefully,

454
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,720
that you could just expand into these transitions again somehow, so that you

455
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,680
don't just see 5. User flow. As I said, for me it is always a very, very important topic,

456
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,240
because I can derive so much from it. So because I want the people, the visitors

457
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,040
of my website, the users, to come to my target pages, where I want them to be,

458
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,320
namely on the product pages, maybe in the shop, or on the overview pages,

459
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:17,280
on my news portals or whatever. I see how the user navigates,

460
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,760
that is what is also asked very often. Yes, how is the behavior on the page?

461
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,240
I can see that from this predecessor, successor. And when does the user start searching?

462
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,560
I can see that from there. And from that I can, in turn, derive measures for SEO. How can I

463
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,760
improve my menu structure and how can I improve the internal links?

464
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,040
So that is of course a very, very important aspect, always in here. Tip number 5,

465
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,040
the performance. It's nice that you know TUMO, yes, and I just see a great distribution here in the end

466
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,760
. You say, okay, everything looks like this, yes, it's at least the same. You

467
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,720
have one or two days here and a few outliers, but please, at this point, the page load time,

468
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,560
that's something that Google also sees very, very quickly. And there are currently,

469
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,480
in my opinion, too many error lines in this evaluation of TUMO. Because I just,

470
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,040
depending on where, for example, I put the TUMO script in and maybe

471
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:24,520
also load scripts beforehand and then reload TUMO only later. Because if that's with the

472
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,920
tech manager, it might be different, but with the normal one, it just always needs that.

473
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,400
That's why I always have a bit of a problem with measuring there. And also there,

474
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,680
often seen after the module is still very, very new, also available since version 4,

475
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,720
that I sometimes just see that there are still bugs in the preparation.

476
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,280
That's why my tip at this point, if you go in, for example, and say you want to take the

477
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,560
right loading time, then we take such tools as WebPageTest or Google PageSpeed,

478
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,040
because they set the standard. That means, if I check that today, if I check that tomorrow, I

479
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,760
always check it under the same conditions. In other words, the device behind it that

480
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,440
captures the loading time, that's still with the same configuration. Here in this

481
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,840
performance, you would actually have to filter it out now and say, for mobile devices and

482
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,040
maybe sort out different brands there, what is the loading time there, how is it on the

483
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,560
desktop. I would really have to go in here again and see where my problems actually hang.

484
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,080
And these two tools are really to be recommended. Nevertheless, of course, there is also the

485
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,520
topic of WebVirtuals, where I can quickly get these data into Matomo. And there are two

486
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,920
plugins that I would recommend to you. One is the Performance Auto Plugin. That is free,

487
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,760
is a bit tricky to install, I honestly write that too, because you need

488
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,960
Node.js here, because Node.js has to run on the server to calculate these values yourself and

489
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,320
then also to record for the pages. That means, a script runs through every night,

490
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,000
which then performs this calculation. The values that come out of it are very, very good.

491
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,520
So that also corresponds to what the other tools actually offer in this regard.

492
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,400
Plus, as I said, it's a bit tricky to install. But if you can do that,

493
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,840
then you have all these values. And on the other hand, there is a cost-effective one from

494
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:23,640
InnoCraft, i.e. from Matomo itself. That is cost-effective, yes, but at this point it is

495
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,480
simply, let's say, easier to integrate into this whole topic. The data

496
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,480
investigation is a bit different at this point. Here the API is pulled from Google.

497
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,000
That's nice and good, but not necessarily the super cool effect on very large pages.

498
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because you only have a certain number of API credits at Google and I think they go up to

499
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,040
10,000. So if you have a page where you say 15,000-20,000 sub-pages and I would like to have it for every page,

500
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:58,600
then this is not the point. Both tools, however, in the end show similar metrics.

501
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,120
They tell me exactly what is going on on my page, so to speak, in relation to these web

502
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:11,680
websites, bad, CLS, LCP, these values, also the overview average, which Google or in the end

503
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:19,120
which score is achieved there. You can see that in both tools. So it's about tip 6, the last tip,

504
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,560
so to speak, to identify the bad link givers. So bad link givers are of course

505
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,840
also pages that may bring me visitors, but then also send bad signals on my

506
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:36,120
page. And you should just take a look at the source. And you have

507
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:42,160
these actions here on average, how many actions there were. And if I have sources

508
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,000
in it, where I notice, for example, that visitors are coming, but unfortunately I get a very high

509
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,680
jump rate here. And the pass rate is also very, very low for the visitors. Then I can

510
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:01,920
read these out here right away and show them to me. And then see, also in the segmentation log,

511
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,040
which is also a very good overview. If you then drive over these links here, then you get

512
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:13,400
them already shown. Where did they arrive? And then see, okay, can I maybe write down the link giver

513
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,880
and say, look, this content there, it doesn't somehow fit with yours, what you

514
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,440
have linked. Can you maybe adjust that again? Maybe I could optimize it that way. Or I

515
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,960
can also think about it, because there are also many spam portals or referer spam at this

516
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,520
point, which can then also be filtered out or blocked out. So I can get a little bit of

517
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:41,200
a grip on that. And again, the best links are of course also the ones that bring visitors to me,

518
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,160
so to speak, count here as backlinks. I can then also take a look at them and

519
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,360
also derive measures from them for SEO. As I said, that's actually it, unfortunately

520
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,280
already at the end. I just explained that again as a summary of two minutes. That means

521
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,800
always see the jump rate and expiration date in context. I think that's very, very important,

522
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:08,600
especially to track sync content. The data layers, the data information that I have,

523
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:14,160
should be enriched with different custom dimensions, with events, for example,

524
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:21,880
to be able to filter better here and to see the data better. Use segments intensively,

525
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:28,840
so as I said, typical segments, channel type and device type, because then I can

526
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:35,400
also make comparisons again, use events more intensively, set up 400 or 500 errors

527
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,120
that an event is then sent immediately, use the scroll depth to identify

528
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,920
whether the article was really read down to the bottom. Of course, it is not that

529
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,520
significant, but it is definitely better to see 1000 pages and only 20 have seen the

530
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,440
footer at the bottom, because then I just see, okay, maybe the people have already

531
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,640
left before and haven't read it to the end. So be sure to use scroll depth.

532
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,640
User path, that's just very, very important for the internal structure of the website.

533
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,280
Do I maybe have a menu somewhere where I also, and that's what I always say,

534
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,960
I'm a fan of Zillowing and Zillowing means I only have links on my pages that are

535
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,480
in the topic environment. That's also what I find very, very well implemented in the fashion

536
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,740
area at Zalando, because when I'm in a world, in a

537
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,840
theme world, then I only have links on the page that also have to do with this

538
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:40,040
theme world and no longer 600 links over the menu. And just predecessors and successors,

539
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:45,280
that's exactly the point. There I can show these data to the customer and say,

540
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,720
look, these are the frequent links that are also clicked there. So the interest is there.

541
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,440
The internal search can help me to better identify these contents that are

542
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,480
searched for. With us it was quite classic in the shop that the people wrote a lot of brands wrong,

543
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,160
because they didn't know it better either. And in the end we just expanded our

544
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:12,200
internal search so that we could enter aliases there and then in the end

545
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,120
led the people back to the right direction and thus generated more revenue. That wasn't

546
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,560
so bad either. And also to cover up the bad links. So what brings me visitors,

547
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:29,640
but these visitors are all, rather, bad values, bad signals in relation to

548
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,880
values ​​such as jump rate and passing time or then of course in the e-commerce area, where I say

549
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,880
I track my goals and my conversions. There is also the which bad back links,

550
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,280
so to speak, never count on my whole things. Maybe just a note,

551
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,120
because it just flew around in the other project. Please pay more attention to what

552
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,000
Blogspot is doing right now. So they don't do it themselves, but they have a huge

553
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,320
band problem right now and we already have two or three large newspaper publishers who really had to

554
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,800
suffer. Yes, that's it from my side. As I said, here again my contact details.

555
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,480
Feel free to write to me via the various platforms if you have any questions.

556
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:21,080
Yes, and otherwise I hope that the lecture was good and despite the short interruption that you

557
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:27,360
could take a lot with you. Exactly, so if there are still questions now, I don't want to

558
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:35,560
discourage you. And I can turn on my camera here too. Then you also have a picture for the

559
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:46,200
face. If that now transfers a picture to the film. Exactly, so hello from me too.

560
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:59,640
Exactly, so if there are questions, please just put yourself through. Yes, I had already

561
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,040
initially, as you talked about the topic of jump rates, I wrote in the chat

562
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:10,040
that you can also set the heartbeat timer. Exactly, yes. That even on a single page,

563
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,480
I have a blog and there I have a very high jump rate on one page,

564
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,040
that's why I discovered the heartbeat timer, at least to measure a stay time.

565
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,320
That might be an important note. Exactly, maybe also here at this point, there are a lot of

566
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:30,720
ideas from Google Analytics to switch over to Matomo. There it is also the case that, for example,

567
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,280
in Google Analytics, the events, when I set them, for example, something like button clicks

568
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,880
or downloads and so on, that they then also completely, so to speak, the jump rate

569
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,960
or also the stay time, then also send. That means there is simply a different

570
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,600
way of doing things than we do at Matomo. That's why at this point, really a very good tip,

571
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,400
also with the heartbeat timer. However, it is not used that often,

572
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,280
because I also have the problem very, very often that it sends every 15 seconds,

573
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,080
I can configure that. First of all, it sends every 15 seconds back home,

574
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:12,960
which for many is similar to a page impression, leads to great loads. And the second

575
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,360
is that many already have historical data, which of course no longer work properly,

576
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:25,360
because you then compare before heartbeat timer to the right times. I definitely recommend heartbeat timer

577
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:30,680
in any case. Especially, of course, when you have single page applications,

578
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,760
you know that very often in the meantime. There is only one page and there are

579
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,840
perhaps different anchor jumps on the website and then I have no

580
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:44,240
values ​​to pass by. And that's why, as I said, at this point a lot of good

581
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,240
use of this heartbeat timer.

582
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:02,160
Oh, one more note, especially for those who have joined the WordPress plugin in Matomo,

583
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,040
the heartbeat timer can be activated very easily with a little hook.

584
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:11,280
Exactly, you have to say that didn't work at the beginning, you still repaired something,

585
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:18,920
because the heartbeat timer was a bit destroyed with version 4 and couldn't be set up properly

586
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,920
via the tech manager. That should now also work, as I said, from WordPress.

587
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,720
I also know it, most of the net users really use WordPress and that's where it works.

588
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,960
Should you just be aware that it is always sent home every 15 seconds,

589
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,960
for example, it will be said, I'm still there, I'm still there, I'm still there.

590
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,960
Yes, so if there are no more questions, I'm also on Facebook, I'm on Xing,

591
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,960
you should also find me relatively easily on the Internet. If there are still questions,

592
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,960
go to the workshop or maybe just topics where you want to discuss it or say,

593
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,960
yes, I might see it differently, I'm very open, as I said, as far as the whole topic is concerned.

594
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,960
Yes, otherwise I thank you, I hope, as I said, it was an interesting lecture,

595
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,960
the slides and so on, the recording and all that, I hope that it will also be distributed

596
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,960
by Matomo himself or by the organizers here and shared.

597
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:36,960
And yes, then I thank you for your attention and I look forward to seeing you again.
