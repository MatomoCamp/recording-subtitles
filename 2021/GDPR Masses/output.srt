00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello everyone, my name is Christian. I'm greeting you from the city of Halle an der Saale in the

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:15,840
beautiful country of Germany and well straight to topic we are going to talk more or less exactly

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:25,680
about that. We or to be more specific I am seated in Germany, in Europe, in the European Union

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,880
where we are in GDPR country. So the general data protection regulation

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:43,360
in effect since 2018 has changed some things to be a little understated in this case and we're

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,520
looking about the public reaction. So Matomo and the masses. Do the people really care about GDPR

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,120
compliance? This is one of the big USPs, one of the big unique selling points of Matomo in general.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:09,200
It's well in very big letters on the home page as well that Matomo is a data secure alternative

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,840
to Google Analytics and to other in this case not open but closed source

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,920
software. So is this even a good selling point in this case? So what do the people think about

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:35,520
data security, about data privacy? So to be a starter here if you can't see the infographics

12
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,520
that well we can provide you with the presentation afterwards. This is no problem. Anyway this is

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:54,160
here, sorry if I'm not having the exact words in any case, but we were asking some people or in

14
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:02,800
this case Statista. So how have the new data protection regulations, the GDPR impacted on

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:16,480
your sense of security? Did anything change after the GDPR came into effect?

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,240
This was asked in this case to be exactly in Sweden. So we are in northern Europe and according to the

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,720
survey 75% said well no difference in any way. So most of the people well before GDPR and after

18
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:42,560
GDPR no difference at all. 14% at least said I feel more secure now. So the GDPR at least

19
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,760
for around every sixth person did make a positive difference, had a positive impact.

20
00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:00,560
For 4% not so much they said I feel less secure and well 7% do not know anything about it or didn't

21
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:14,720
care. But in this case so sorry in this case so the majority well didn't think there was a big

22
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:23,840
difference before and after the GDPR and at least 14-15% around about feel more secure through the

23
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,800
GDPR. So in this case most people had at least in Sweden it's seen as a having a positive impact.

24
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:42,880
So the GDPR as a force of good if you want to say. But how is it done on the well more

25
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,400
regional or state level in this case? So another survey about GDPR enforcement. So the data

26
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:00,400
protection authorities this case lack of expertise. So most public administration

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:10,000
is not really ready for GDPR enforcement. But one second I've got a question from Ronan. Have you

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,600
ever heard of German citizens suing any websites because of a misuse of a web analytics solution?

29
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:24,560
I will come to that in a moment. But regarding the public authorities in this case you well they

30
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,960
aren't seen as that fit for the digital age in this case. Mostly because we have for example in

31
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:41,040
Germany which is this case the country on the far left side. We have around 700 people in personnel

32
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,960
doing non-technical stuff and only about 100. So one in seven people is a technical expert.

33
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,440
In this case everyone else not so much. In other countries it's sometimes even more extreme.

34
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,040
For example UK which isn't part of the European Union anymore. But there we have 22 technical

35
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:14,160
experts regarding to 658 non-technical personnel. So this is a bit more extreme in this case. So the

36
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:22,240
public authorities are very dependent on the populace to well talk to them regarding

37
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,240
well data breaches. And to come into Ronan's question yeah I have heard of German citizens

38
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,800
suing well not the website themselves. In Germany you can't sue a website because of a data privacy

39
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,080
breach. You have to make an amend to the local authority in this case to the well data protection

40
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:56,400
authority. In Germany data protection is a thing for the specific German states. For example in my

41
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,800
case I'm living in a state of Saxony-Anhalt in Germany. And just recently I'm working as a data

42
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,920
protection officer as well. And just recently I've actually had a case where an online shop was sued

43
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,440
by a person who wasn't a client from that shop. Because the shop well did

44
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:27,120
well did had some settings that weren't exactly GDPR conform. So

45
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,760
it happens but you can't sue, at least in Germany, you can't sue a website directly.

46
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,400
But you can make an inquiry with your local data protection authority. So this has happened.

47
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,880
This happens sometimes a lot but not so much in Germany as it is in some other countries. For

48
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:01,040
example many complaints were made in Italy and Spain if I recall correctly. Surprisingly not so

49
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:13,200
much in Germany where as regarding stereotypes we Germans have a bit of an image

50
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:21,760
as the big complainers. But in other countries it was well far worse to be put in brackets in

51
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:31,040
this case. But to be answering that shortly, yes it happens, yes it happened. And this is not so

52
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,520
much the fault in this case of the web analytics solution itself but of the company who uses

53
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:46,800
this solution. For example when you normally use Google Analytics in the general setting when you

54
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:56,640
just implement Google Analytics but Matomo as well with the well default settings they aren't GDPR

55
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:04,080
compliant. You need to put them in some kind of a sandbox, the typical cookie banners in this case.

56
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:13,920
And you have to ask your customers or your users, your website users before you track anything from

57
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:22,320
them. You have to ask them if they are okay with that and you have to have an explicit yes and no

58
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,600
button on this cookie banner. And when you do that you're fine. When you do it not, well up until

59
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:37,600
this year maybe there wasn't a data protection authority who was complaining about it but it

60
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:45,200
happens rarely. But beginning at least in Germany beginning with next year the public authorities

61
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:53,440
declared that they would control these well for example websites or businesses or companies or

62
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:04,000
whatever. But it would control the GDPR compliancy far more thoroughly. So some things at least

63
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,760
will change in 2022. And this case but moving on I hope I answered your question.

64
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,080
Well for gathering these facts at least so not much has changed in everyday lives of the people.

65
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Maybe that some people are complaining about having to click on so many cookie banners on websites.

66
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,800
At least that's what I get in Germany that people like to complain that with the GDPR everything is

67
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,520
far more complicated and you well at least that's what I'm saying. They are complaining about having

68
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:55,280
to make a decision. So I guess this will become a far more used to in coming years. But right now

69
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:04,080
we putting aside this nuisance in this case not much has changed. At least the public sees it that

70
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,080
way as well that the authorities across countries don't have much expertise in the topic.

71
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:19,600
So in essence why should the populace care about using data friendly solutions.

72
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,200
Right now it's a bit of a nuisance. In some countries data protection is even seen as

73
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:38,400
well kind of an hindering stone for innovation or for other things. So why should the populace care?

74
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,280
In this case sorry for the German speaking part in this case but I will translate.

75
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,640
Well one big part could be Corona pandemic in this case and the use of the

76
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,240
German we called home office. No offense to the Brits in this case. So the home office the remote

77
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:09,680
working situations we have at least since March 2020. Different in many countries but at least in

78
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:20,000
Germany there was a survey made by the BVDW. This is a German

79
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:35,360
association for the digital business economics. So they did a survey anyway regarding

80
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:46,160
can you imagine working in home office working remotely because of COVID or after that as well.

81
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,200
In this case around three quarters 75.4 percent said yeah I can imagine working from now on

82
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:07,280
remotely. 66 percent even expect their employers to have an appropriate technical as well other

83
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:16,080
kind of solution for working remotely and 58 percent even said that they want to have the explicit

84
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:26,400
possibility of working remotely. In this case in Germany we had some not laws but some

85
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:36,080
guidances that came to effect during the lockdown phases of the pandemic but they were well they

86
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,600
were running out during the way of the summer so they are no longer in effect in Germany. However

87
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,320
in neighboring Austria since April they even have home office laws so in this case remote working

88
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,680
laws. So very different situation depending on the country but at least the German populace wishes to

89
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:05,360
have more home office possibilities but they doubt as with the public authorities they doubt that

90
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:14,400
their employers are ready for that. So in this case the white the right survey was asking questions

91
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,560
is your employer well technically ready so have they the do they have the technical infrastructure

92
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:32,800
to enable you to work remotely and this case 54 percent said yes but also 45 percent said no

93
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:41,440
and regarding the mistrust of an employer this is even higher. So this for once. Also regarding

94
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,280
the lockdown phases maybe some of you experienced this in your countries as well when you had

95
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:56,240
lockdowns. I've here had some newspaper clippings regarding the consequences of lockdown. For

96
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:10,080
example in Cologne there even was an app developed regarding the well corona regulations chaos that

97
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:18,640
ensued because every state made more or less their own rules. There was a bit of chaos there also

98
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:28,320
regarding the so-called home schooling so the lockdown school school stuff sorry

99
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:38,320
which was also a big mess at least in Germany. So the typical joke was going on yeah what do we

100
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:46,160
expect only teachers working in school they don't have a clue about IT infrastructure.

101
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,640
So of course for example when in December in a hard lockdown was set in Germany and first day of

102
00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:02,480
so-called home schooling was done of course every server was well stressed to the seams and broke

103
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:11,920
down. So in this case regarding corona and lockdown situation people are on one hand

104
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:21,680
a bit in mistrust regarding data protection but on the other hand see well digitalization as a

105
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:31,920
necessity at least and maybe in combination of the two and well populace will develop the

106
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:40,000
perspective that I'm working more and more in the digital realm that who

107
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,280
controls my employer that he's not sniffing after me that he's not trying to survey me to spy on me.

108
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:58,800
And at least in Germany I've got here some paper clippings as well regarding the well general

109
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:06,080
well the general outlook for example especially no not for example especially in regards to the

110
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:14,320
gayfam economy so Google, Amazon, Facebook, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, etc. They are well

111
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:23,600
general in mistrust I especially like that one thing that said well regarding Google Pay and Co.

112
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:34,080
They are warning once again of them so even the journalists are getting tired of well

113
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,000
well reporting about data protection incidents with Facebook, with Google, with everyone else.

114
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,920
So on the one hand people don't really like data protection because well it's

115
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:56,720
hindrance, it's nuisance, it's well stuff to do that I don't want to do. But on the other hand

116
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:06,640
we are at least when regarding Germany we are a very mistrustful folk regarding big corporations.

117
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,840
It has a lot to do with our history regarding kings and queens doing as they please regarding

118
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,520
the national socialist regime in the 1930s and 40s regarding the star sea and the German

119
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:28,320
democratic republic and the Iron Curtain stuff that happened. So we value on one hand at least

120
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:38,640
in Germany we value our privacy very high but data protection is for many seen as some kind of

121
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,600
nuisance so this is a bit schizophrenic in this case but that's the situation at least in Germany

122
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:54,720
where we are. And to summarize this one so remote work is more prevalent the dangers for

123
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,440
data privacy are more apparent. One thing that works in Germany very very good is the stuff

124
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,160
think about the children for example in school when you have to work with for example Zoom with

125
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:16,560
Microsoft Teams with whatever. Often it's the case that teachers as well as parents as well

126
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,880
as the general populace they say well if it works it works and it's free so it's okay.

127
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,040
That's the one hand but on the other hand the well safety of children of families

128
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:39,840
as well as the general safety is stressed very highly. So as I said a bit of a schizophrenic

129
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:50,720
situation in this case but something at least the German speaking countries have at least some kind

130
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,240
of well sensibility in this case. So they say we well we have to do something to keep us safe.

131
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:06,320
What? I don't know that's the general thing in this case but authorities are controlling more

132
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:14,000
often as I said in beginning in 2022 the German data protection authorities said that they

133
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:24,320
want and will control more frequently. So what can we do regarding Matomo? So what strategies

134
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:32,480
could we apply? For once we need to look more abroad. In this case we need to look at other

135
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:41,360
countries when we are living in Europe. The GDPR is often seen as some kind of nuisance at least.

136
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,160
Regarding international situations these countries that are on this map green they were

137
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:58,400
implementing laws in recent years that had the GDPR as a template, as an explicit template.

138
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,760
Some countries are not doing so well regarding data protection for example in Brazil and

139
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,440
also in Australia. This is well not that good of a situation but this is because there are

140
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,160
other laws like in the United States for example the state of California implemented a specific

141
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:28,160
law that was modeled after the GDPR. But unfortunately California is part of the United States in this

142
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:38,560
case and the United States have laws like the US Freedom Act, the US Cloud Act and other laws

143
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:49,760
that are above the Californian law and enable public administration. In this case specific

144
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:57,520
offices like the National Security Agency, the NSA and other well security organs of the state

145
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:09,760
to spy out everything that is saved on a server even if it's in Europe. The US Cloud Act which

146
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:17,280
came into effect in 2018 explicitly states that in regards of homeland security and stuff like that

147
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:27,680
that the public authorities are enabled to control every person, corporation etc.

148
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,680
and the stuff that they are having for example they can control everything that is saved on

149
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:43,200
any Microsoft service because Microsoft has its seat in the United States even if the server is

150
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
in Germany. The company is in the United States and that's the general problem in this case.

151
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:58,320
So on the one hand the GDPR is a template, is a model for well similar laws in the world

152
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,400
but on the other hand we have I don't want to call a loophole but we have another situation

153
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:17,280
where we have other countries that are well GDPR compliant without having the GDPR as a law in their

154
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:26,080
country. So on the one hand we can look into countries that are having laws specifically

155
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,960
made after the GDPR for for example for marketing and stuff like that so there we could market

156
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:43,040
Matomo as a good alternative. Also in these countries that are here labeled green we can

157
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:55,360
also have the GDPR as a some kind of a quality seal because Matomo is open source and everything

158
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:03,360
open source and everything else. It's a good starting point for having a well GDPR compliant

159
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:12,800
tool and these countries here Canada well for commercial organizations at least so Canada is

160
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,520
half and half in this case regarded safe but the states or the countries of Switzerland,

161
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:30,800
of Norway, of Iceland, of Argentina, Uruguay, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Israel and

162
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:40,640
well some other countries as well like the Channel Isles so these specific constituency

163
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:51,200
that are and are not part of Great Britain as well as some other parts of Black Faroe Islands

164
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,760
in the Northern Sea they have a specific situation regarding their legal status so they are part of

165
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:05,520
it as well and the fun stuff actually is since Brexit Great Britain officially became at least

166
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:13,440
for three years GDPR compliant again but I would call this more like a political dealing than

167
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:21,840
real well real legislation in this case but the Channel Islands in this case like the Isle of

168
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:29,040
Guernsey or the Isle of Man there are more GDPR compliant than the whole of the UK in this case

169
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:36,000
because they have a so-called adequacy decision from the European Commission so this is some kind

170
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:47,040
of well you apply for that there's some kind of application there's a multi-step and a multi-year

171
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:54,160
inspection of the laws and of the practices in the specific countries that are applying for these

172
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:04,000
adequacy decisions and for example in June 2021 South Korea was admitted after three years being

173
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,080
observed and well applying for the status of an adequacy decision GDPR compliant whatever you want

174
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:22,080
to call it country so these countries have laws in effect that are on the same level as the GDPR

175
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:30,160
in the European Union so in this case every company every citizen every corporation

176
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:39,440
every entity in this country have has to have well technical solutions tools software that is

177
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:51,760
in essence GDPR compliant so Matomo could look into these countries regarding getting a foothold and

178
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,800
they are in this case to differentiate it more clearly from tools like Google Analytics and stuff

179
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,760
because you could at least in these countries the blue ones are part of the European Union the green

180
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:11,520
ones are safe in this case because in this these countries you can argue with legal consequences

181
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:18,560
when you use Google Analytics in these countries and you don't do it right you can get well sued

182
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:28,160
or have to pay a fine or whatever and regarding the GDPR the fine can go up to 20 million euros

183
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:39,680
per case or risk case scenario four percent of your of your global revenue no sorry global income

184
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:51,440
so the gross income to be exact for example in 2019 Google was sentenced in France to pay a fine

185
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:01,440
of 50 million euros and just this year Amazon was in I think was Sweden Spain somewhere in the

186
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:09,760
European Union I have to look it up where exactly but Amazon had to pay a fine for some of 700

187
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:22,400
million euros because every one of these companies they were well violating data protection so in

188
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,360
worst case scenario Google is fined and you have to pay a fine as well because you are using Google

189
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:40,880
you are using an illegal software and at least regarding to Germany we have the we have the

190
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:48,240
local authorities as I said the data protection in Germany is part as a matter for the states

191
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,200
so not the federal government is doing the data protection but every state has a specific office

192
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,360
and the states officials are meeting at least once a year for so-called federal data protection

193
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:13,600
meetings and at least in September 2020 the conference data protection conference in Germany

194
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:25,920
they said that American specifically US American companies are not legal in Germany

195
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:37,360
they explicitly mentioned Microsoft 365 and just in February this year the data protection

196
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,720
authority in the state of Berlin said that for example Cisco WebEx was illegal so in this case

197
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,000
Cisco WebEx was mentioned specifically but among others like zoom as well this case the state of

198
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,760
Baden-Württemberg which is in the south west one of the richest richest states in Germany

199
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:09,040
they well more or less outlawed zoom in 2020 in March 2020 then zoom did some paperwork and the

200
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:18,880
outlawing was well was reversed and just a well general warning label that every United States

201
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:27,280
company has in Germany was applied but in any case the at least the public authorities have a very

202
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:38,480
very very or putting very strict eye on every United States based company on this case on every

203
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:50,480
non-EU based company okay so and regarding once again the well this case companies but also part

204
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,760
they are part of the general populace so they should count that well as well this case French

205
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:05,040
companies were asked so what are the implications of the GDPR according to well French data driven

206
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:13,840
and non-data driven companies so in essence the light blue ones are regarding data driven

207
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:22,880
companies the dark blue ones are non-data driven companies so in general IT digital internet

208
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,320
based companies on one hand and more or less traditional companies on the other hand

209
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,760
and in general the traditional companies see the GDPR more as a constraint

210
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:45,360
whereas the data driven companies so the more or less IT based companies see the GDPR well in

211
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,200
this case as a guideline to improve marketing strategies as well as an opportunity for customer

212
00:30:51,200 --> 00:31:00,160
relationship some also see it as a constraint but in this case more data driven companies see

213
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:08,320
the GDPR as a general good thing for well developing their marketing strategies as well

214
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:17,120
as the customer relationship so they see it as an opportunity so in this case to make the best out

215
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:26,480
of the law this best case scenario even to make it as a part of an USP in this case the unique

216
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:34,720
selling point could be we are GDPR compliant we value your privacy something that Matomo already

217
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:45,120
does so nothing new for you guys at least but something that also many companies see so in this

218
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:57,840
case the public opinion at least in well IT centric industries is more pro GDPR than contra GDPR

219
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:07,520
because the sorry because the companies are already working with data they are

220
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:18,320
fluent in this field etc so a company could in best case scenario could use the GDPR and GDPR

221
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:26,640
compliant tools in this case as an advantage in contrast to their opposition to the

222
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,000
to the other parts of the branch sorry I don't have the right words right now

223
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,720
and one company that does it is actually my my own company but I'll come to that in a minute

224
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,440
but data-driven companies are for example these ones some of them you have heard some maybe not

225
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,720
Trello maybe you heard of them they are part of Atlassian now so they are Australia based

226
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,760
and others like monday.com like Dropbox, Asana, Evernote they are US based the ones on the bottom

227
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:09,520
Meister and Meister task they are an Austrian based company so they are on the standard

228
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:19,280
settings GDPR friendly because they must be they have to be it's law so for example these are some

229
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,320
but when you look at other companies that are mostly in the well communications sector

230
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,320
some of them are very very good regarding GDPR compliance for example when you look at

231
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,760
messengers like Signal like Threema also open source stuff like Jitsi or right now we are using

232
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:50,480
big blue button these are okay but some have a bit of well mixed image in this case when you look at

233
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,560
image in this case when you look at zoom they are a big winner of the pandemic you have to admit that

234
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:05,760
at least and many many that are using zoom they think well it's such a great service it's reliant

235
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:15,360
it's blah blah blah whereas zoom is actually a very data hungry service also a very dirty service

236
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:25,120
as well there is a website called website carbon.com where you can put in domains and they will well

237
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:37,280
count how much co2 how much gram co2 does it cost in well energy in an energy production when you

238
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,560
want to look up that site and for example i once tested that one with with my own site we came

239
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:57,200
around 0.69 gram per website use where zoom has around eight or nine gram so tenfold

240
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,080
the stuff so in this case when you use an external service in this case when

241
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:15,120
us based also you have to have taken to account the environmental friendliness so how

242
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:22,400
i don't have the word right now sorry but well how good for the environment how reliable how

243
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,640
sorry how sustainable how sustainable is the service as well this is one thing that

244
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,800
that comes more into effect right now for example when you look at for as for future and other

245
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:46,000
movements so in this case matomo can make points as well regarding well you can install matomo on

246
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
your own service so you can decide how environmentally friendly it will become but also how

247
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,720
regional the service will be you don't have to communicate all the time with the united states

248
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:07,440
or other countries where the servers are so you can decide in this case also another thing that's

249
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:15,360
the service on the right bottom that's cisco webex or the old logo of cisco webex and for example

250
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:26,800
cisco has a seal made that at least was one time i did a seminar for a federal agency and i also

251
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,280
warned about matomo sorry i warned about cisco and stuff cisco webex and stuff not matomo

252
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,120
matomo is all right and fine but webex i warned about them because well they are us based

253
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,320
but then the federal agency told me no no no but it's all right we haven't

254
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,320
this case we have we have a seal made by the german bundesamt für sicherheit in

255
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:58,720
der informationstechnik or transcendent federal agency for safety in the digital infrastructure

256
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:10,800
but the well the bad point is that this seal i looked up they have this seal but well it's

257
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,920
not something that the federal agency itself makes but you more or less can ask your tax advisor to

258
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:25,840
uh give it to you because they are well they um they make an audit at at your company and

259
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:32,880
they say well everything seems fine and now i will get my payment so many many marketing

260
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,840
jargon going on here but that could be something as well all these companies have sometimes very

261
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:48,320
sometimes very flimsy excuses where they say but we are gdp are compliant we are safe we are looking

262
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,160
out after human rights and stuff like that and here's our seal of approval for from the federal

263
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,400
government and stuff like that so something that you could acquire very easily with matomo as well

264
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:09,600
so to put yourself on at least the same level of trust that these companies say that they have or

265
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:17,840
say that they are okay and other companies as well regarding data drivenness when you look at

266
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:25,680
microsoft 365 or google workspace they are in general not gdpr compliant but when you look at

267
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,480
other companies like next cloud that is a german-based company and cloud service i guess

268
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,880
some of you may have heard of it or own cloud that wasn't uh is what was a part of next cloud

269
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,000
this is with all open source it was next cloud is essentially a fork of own cloud like with

270
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,080
open office and libre library office also another company der seminar that is my own for full

271
00:38:52,080 --> 00:39:00,880
enclosure we are working with some api with some api from next cloud we are also working with a

272
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:09,200
big blue button for our video conferencing and at least we ourselves are marketing

273
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,600
the use of open source products we also use matomo for our statistics and we market that as well we

274
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:25,680
are using for example an app called tomorrow that is essentially green and sustainable banking in

275
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,880
this case and we position ourselves with that so when we for example are looking at our campus

276
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:42,080
our campus this is some kind of an office cloud like with microsoft 365 we say in german that you

277
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:49,920
can work there collaboratively and also secure in the cloud because we are using an open source

278
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,360
solution we are in we are based in germany and stuff like that also with a talk plus that

279
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:05,440
essentially is big blue button but well we market it in another way also with other products we have

280
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,240
in this case our media library and everything in this case we will say it's well regional based

281
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:21,120
so the service on germany companies in germany we are sustainable because we look that we only

282
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:32,720
have the energy sources well one case regional but also we only use well eco energy for this is

283
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:42,560
this is one big big stepping stone that our partners our it partners our infrastructure partners

284
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:49,600
have to make that they can guarantee and also then that they can prove that they

285
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:58,880
use the data centers that they power the data centers only with sustainable energy also regarding

286
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,960
security because we are based in gdpr country also with the data protection as well that we have

287
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:18,400
well the regarded that we have some dean or eso norms the iso 27000 and one is for example one

288
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,000
regarding data security data privacy in this case stuff like that for well this case one specific

289
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:36,080
company with the er seminar we even market more or less we market the gdpr as a unique selling

290
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:44,240
point of our company and we specifically target in this case for example lawyers or doctors or

291
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:52,720
other in germany you wouldn't you would call it a professional secret carrier so the most nearest

292
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:01,440
translation would be you are secret keepers based on your job when you are a lawyer you

293
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,800
are forbidden in germany you are forbidden to use messengers like whatsapp or skype etc

294
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:17,360
you have to use secure messengers in this case like threema or like signal or the messengers

295
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:23,120
like with elements which are you which are using the matrix standard stuff like that

296
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,800
lawyers in germany have normally at least legally have to use it as well

297
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:42,640
so this could be a good entry point for matomo as well that you can contact or that you can market

298
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:51,120
yourself for example for companies or for public authorities public authorities have to have even

299
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:59,440
more scrutiny rules to follow regarding data protection okay but what we take from here is

300
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,880
well remote work is more prevalent the dangers for data privacy are more apparent and well

301
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,880
fact how do we approach the matter so in this case we can do it regarding the gdpr compliance

302
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:26,080
that we put the gdpr as well the biggest selling point for matomo also that companies can check

303
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:34,000
for themselves what matomo collects from data and also that they when they used not an on-premise

304
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,440
but download variant of matomo that they have total control over their data

305
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,480
okay and with more or less good landing in this case sorry

306
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:56,800

310
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:33,440
