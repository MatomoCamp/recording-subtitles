1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,940
Okay, and with this, it is three o'clock, and I would like to introduce three people

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:25,160
for the next presentation, namely, Davide Porovesio, Pierluigi Tassi, and Claudio Schelleheim.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,600
And in their talk, they will give an overview of how web analytics with Matomo are used

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,760
in the public section in Italy, including a case study of the long-term usage of Matomo.

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,600
So whenever you're ready, please start.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,920
Hello to everybody.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:50,960
My name is Claudio Schelleheim, as I said, and I'm responsible for the web development

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,520
service in the agency for Digital Italy.

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:07,600
Today I want to present you our solution for monitoring website statistics of public administration

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
in Italy.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,920
And, of course, we used Matomo, and I explained in this very short presentation why we decided

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:32,520
to implement a national statistical platform.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:42,960
From a legal point of view, in Italy we have a core legal context, quite articulated, quite

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,200
complex, which is called Code of Digital Administration.

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:56,960
In Article 7, it says that public administration shall publish on their website data on user

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,160
statistics.

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,880
In the Code of Digital Administration gives you rules about the digital issue for the

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:16,760
public and private entities, and it's a rule, it's a legal framework that must be followed.

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:26,440
And it says that public administration should allow users to express their satisfaction

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,440
on the service quality in terms of usability, accessibility, and timeliness.

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,160
So public administration should also publish, as I said, on their website the resulting

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,640
data, including analytics.

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,720
In Article 53, I don't want to bother you with many legislative aspects, but just to

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:08,720
say that this is something that is required by the law, this code says that the Internet

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,720
side of public administration should respect the principle of accessibility, usability,

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,280
as stated in specific government guidelines.

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:30,360
So public administration should create a website that respects this principle, and about usability,

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,920
findability, completeness of information, clarity of language, reliability, ease of

29
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,960
consultation, homogeneity, and interoperability.

30
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:49,080
Well, all this stuff, as we know, must be, this level of quality can be reached only

31
00:03:49,080 --> 00:04:01,280
by even, well, by monitoring the use of websites or digital services by the users.

32
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:10,200
So of course, there are many, many other ways of projecting good web services, but now just

33
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,600
focus on this aspect.

34
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:21,320
A web agency for digitality wrote these guidelines while we define the modalities for the creation

35
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,840
and modification of Internet websites of public administrations.

36
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,360
These guidelines as well are something that must be followed.

37
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:39,240
It's not something like, can I say, nice to have a feature, but it's something that public

38
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,080
administration should respect.

39
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:53,440
And in these guidelines, we say that, again, the statistics should appear on each website.

40
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,760
The data, this is very important.

41
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:06,000
In this case, data, huge statistics, data remains inside the public administration with

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
the solution we defined.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,920
And what is this solution, the technical solution?

44
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:22,920
We developed a national platform, which is called Web Analytics Italia, and it's an open

45
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:30,800
source solution for collecting, analyzing, and sharing traffic and user behavior data

46
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
dedicated to Italian public administration websites.

47
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:45,480
So in order to analyze and improve the user experience, we decided to develop this national

48
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,960
platform.

49
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:58,520
And this is the very first time in Italy for the government that we have such a tool, such

50
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:11,480
as a platform, and already many, many administrations have joined these solutions.

51
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:20,280
And many more are going to join this platform by next year.

52
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,040
And okay.

53
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:39,160
Going out of Italy, we connected this platform, this solution with the regulation of the single

54
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,200
digital gateway.

55
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:52,800
The regulation 2018, 1724, establishes a single digital gateway at the Europe level to provide

56
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,080
access to information, to procedures, and to assistance and problem-solving services.

57
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:09,080
The website addresses Europe, okay, you can see it on my side.

58
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:17,520
So what do we have to do with Web Analytics Italia based on Matomo and this Europe-Europe

59
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
platform?

60
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:28,840
Well, this single digital gateway has thousands and thousands of links to national web pages,

61
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,000
which contains lots of information, specific information.

62
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:45,240
These statistics about these web pages at national level must be sent to European Commission.

63
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,960
And this is written clearly stated in the regulation.

64
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,840
So national authorities shall ensure that statistics are collected in relation to users'

65
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,040
visits on the gateway and on the web page to which the gateway links in a way that guarantees

66
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,240
anonymity of the users in order to improve the functionality of the gateway.

67
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:22,120
Well, we implemented, we connected this national solution with the Europe-Europe single digital

68
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,840
gateway.

69
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,160
And in this way, we avoid, as many other member states are doing now, we avoid to ask to the

70
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:38,840
single administration to send a file like on Excel or something, stuff like that, to

71
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,400
the European Commission about statistics.

72
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
What kind of information we gather?

73
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,520
Number of visits, very, very basic information, but useful.

74
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Number of visits, number of unique visits per web page, countries from which the user

75
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:06,840
are visiting the web page, type of devices used, and the time spent on page.

76
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:16,480
Very basic ones, but we have set up an automated way to send this information regularly to

77
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,480
the European Commission.

78
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:33,760
Nevertheless, this is the way the web analytics connect with other nodes of the Europe framework.

79
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:55,280
And from until now, the statistics are related to web pages only, and from 2023, these statistics

80
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:05,640
will be related to services online, which will be made available by the end of 2023.

81
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:15,880
My presentation finished here, I thank you very much for your kind attention.

82
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,400
I give the floor to Davide Porovecchio.

83
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Thank you, Claudio.

84
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,440
I switch to my presentation, here we are.

85
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Well, good afternoon.

86
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,760
My name is Davide Porovecchio, I'm the lead developer of Web Analytics Italia, the Italian

87
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,040
national platform for web analytics in the public sector.

88
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,560
WAI, pronounced Y, is the short name we use for Web Analytics Italia.

89
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,960
Well, why am I talking about Web Analytics Italia?

90
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,800
It is the project, now the platform, that brought us in-depth knowledge of Matomo.

91
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,240
WAI is evolving, of course, and follow the evolution of Matomo as well.

92
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,880
For example, one of the next steps in our roadmap will be to upgrade to version 4 of

93
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,200
Matomo.

94
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
Three main points about WAI.

95
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,080
The first, as established by the Italian law, the collection of statistical data is mandatory

96
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,720
for public bodies.

97
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,000
The use of WAI, however, is not mandatory, but recommended, because a central collection

98
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,440
point has many advantages, as we'll discuss in a moment.

99
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,240
WAI, third point, is connected to two other national platforms.

100
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,880
One is IndicePia, which is the directory of all the public administration, and the other

101
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,200
one is Speed, the Italian digital identity system.

102
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,320
When we started designing Web Analytics Italia, Matomo was the natural choice, because, as

103
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,240
you already know, it is completely open source, can be extended with custom plugin and configured

104
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,280
according to specific needs.

105
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:19,560
In addition to all this consideration, Italian law requires public administration to use

106
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:29,560
open source solutions when available, so we had no other choice than Matomo.

107
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,800
The possibility to collect data in one central point was a strategic decision to allow national

108
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,280
analysis and to address certain processes, such as the updating of guidelines for the

109
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,120
design of public websites, as Claudio told before me.

110
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:57,240
Now that the platform is quite stable, even if still in beta, we are planning an extensive

111
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:04,320
analysis of the data collected to extract valuable information about the interaction

112
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,200
of Italian citizens with public administration websites and, of course, the quality of the

113
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,720
websites.

114
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,440
Most of the administrations using Web Analytics Italia to monitor the traffic of their websites

115
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
are small municipalities or schools.

116
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,280
The ease of use and availability of an institutional solution allowed us to bring this organization

117
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,520
on board with minimal effort.

118
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,160
This is a first step toward our goal in the short term, as we wanted to spread as much

119
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,080
as possible the diffusion of Web Analytics among Italian public administration.

120
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Okay, GDPR.

121
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,080
It can be a concern, we know, especially for small organizations.

122
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:07,680
The recent CNIL recommendation has confirmed that our choice to use Matomo was the right

123
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,000
one.

124
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,840
The guidelines of the Italian Data Protection Authority also point out that if we use Matomo

125
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:23,040
with the proper configuration that anonymizes personal data, we can collect statistics without

126
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,760
requiring explicit user consent.

127
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:38,040
As you can see in this simple diagram, so we are switching to explain, I'm going to

128
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:47,080
discuss now how we use Matomo, well, the discussion until now was about why we use Matomo.

129
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,720
Well, as you can see in this simple diagram, our users interact with why, front-end, for

130
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,480
logging in and for websites and user management, but they eventually switch to Matomo directly

131
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,720
when they need to view dashboards.

132
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,200
Why interacts with Matomo via API to perform the task requested by the user, and this interaction

133
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,720
happens in the back-end.

134
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,240
The tracking side is completely managed by Matomo with a configuration that I will discuss

135
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,120
in a moment.

136
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,640
This is the onboarding process for Italian public administration.

137
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:37,160
Well, after logging in, the user selects an administration and the corresponding URL is

138
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,600
retrieved from IndicePA, the directory of Italian administration.

139
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:50,000
At this point, why creates a new website in Matomo and provides the tracking code to the

140
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,200
user, so it can be included in the source code of the specific website.

141
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:03,240
Only after the visit starts to be tracked, why we create a new account in Matomo, thus

142
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,240
allowing access to the dashboard for the user.

143
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,480
With this pattern, we can be fairly sure that the user has permission to modify the code

144
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:23,080
of the institutional website listed in IndicePA for the selected administration.

145
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:31,680
Single Digital Gateway was described by Claudio some minutes ago, and is a regulation of the

146
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,520
European Commission that states, among other things, that each member state should collect

147
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,240
statistics on visit to the pages that are part of the Your Europe network.

148
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,320
Your Europe is a portal for European citizens looking for information rights, rules and

149
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,560
procedures for their personal and professional activities within the European Union.

150
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:04,000
The regulation requires that statistics for each page are transmitted using a country

151
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,680
device matrix.

152
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:13,320
Thanks to Matomo, we are able to easily build a system based on creating a segment for each

153
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:21,520
URL device pair and then querying the API with the userCountry.getCountry method for

154
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,600
each segment.

155
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,560
The resulting data is then structured in format required and automatically sent to the servers

156
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,840
of the European Commission.

157
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Well, our architecture of Web Analytics Italia is hosted within a cloud service provider

158
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,080
that is made available to the Italian public administration.

159
00:17:51,080 --> 00:18:00,040
The Y platform is based on IS type services.

160
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,320
Within our structure, we have installed a Kubernetes cluster that we use to orchestrate

161
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,640
the different containers that make up the whole system.

162
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,680
The only element outside of the Kubernetes cluster is the DBMS, which is installed on

163
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,240
a dedicated virtual machine for performance reasons.

164
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,880
For the portal component, which evolves faster than the other components, we have activated

165
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,600
the continuous integration, continuous deployment system that allows us to stay up to date with

166
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,720
the code in our GitHub repository.

167
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,960
In the next slide, I'm going to discuss in more detail the different Matomo containers

168
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,880
you can see now in this diagram.

169
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,360
We have four different types of Matomo containers.

170
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,480
Obviously, we use Qt tracking plugin.

171
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:05,640
So the first one is the ingestion container, which only expose the Matomo dot PHP endpoint

172
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:14,020
to the outside world and collect data and then queue them inside the Redis component.

173
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:20,900
The workers containers not exposed to the outside world, which dequeue the data from

174
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,560
Redis and load them into the database.

175
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:33,480
Then the third kind of container is the web container and is it exposed to the outside,

176
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:40,680
but only accessible by authenticated users, basically those coming from the web portal.

177
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,280
And it's for dashboards and reporting in general.

178
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:53,120
The last one is the API container, which at the moment only allow the visualization of

179
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:01,440
widgets, but with some limitation that I will discuss in a moment.

180
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Okay about providing widgets to authorize the organization.

181
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,880
In order to provide our users with the possibility of displaying widgets on their website without

182
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,800
at the same time allowing the widgets to be included in any other website.

183
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,100
We have adopted the two tire solution on the web server using a specific script.

184
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,960
We add in the response to a request for a widget, a content security policy header with

185
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,860
the value frame ancestors and the URL corresponding in Matomo to the site ID in the request.

186
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:48,120
So the browser will show the frame only if embedded in the specified URL.

187
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,560
In Matomo, this is the second tire, we then use a custom plugin that rejects all requests

188
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:02,960
that do not contain the module equal widgetized parameter in the query string.

189
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,360
To avoid rejecting valid requests coming from inside the widgetized frame, the plugin let

190
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:24,240
them pass if they contain the string module equal widgetized inside the refer Http header.

191
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:34,640
Some performance metrics, well at Web Analytics Italy, we now have 677 tracking websites.

192
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:45,520
These websites belong to 590 public administrations and considering that in Italy we have about

193
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,880
20,000 different administrations, we are still far from good coverage, but the project has

194
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
already been quite successful and is growing fast.

195
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:06,960
At the moment we are getting about 50 million visits per month for a total of about 140

196
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,560
million page views.

197
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,800
The incoming traffic to the ingestion component averages something like 200 transactions per

198
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:25,760
second with peaks of up to 350 transactions per second.

199
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,840
Our keeping job is currently our least performing component because it takes almost 12 hours

200
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
to complete.

201
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:43,080
Bear in mind, however, that 590 roll ups, one for each administration, must be added

202
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:56,520
to the 677 websites, so we have more than 1,300 websites to process in their keeping

203
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
job.

204
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,360
Well, this finishes my presentation.

205
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,480
I want to thank everyone for listening.

206
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
All of what I've described is public and open source.

207
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:24,560
Our two main repositories are on github.com, and the other one is the same but has the

208
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,520
final part, wai-infrastructure.

209
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,600
Now I leave the floor to Pierluigi Tassi from Emilia Romagna region who will discuss about

210
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,240
another experience with Matuomo in the Italian public sector.

211
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Thank you.

212
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Sorry.

213
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Hello, everybody.

214
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Thank you.

215
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,280
Thank you, Davide, for explaining your project.

216
00:23:51,280 --> 00:24:00,040
And thank you for joining because to explain to all the audience the big project you are

217
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,840
doing for the entire Italian public administration.

218
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm speaking from Bologna, where you're situated in the region Emilia Romagna that is a smaller

219
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,960
administration, a smaller area of administration.

220
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:39,560
And the region is situated in the northern area of Italy, and it's counting four million

221
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:48,160
and a half residents in an area, an important area.

222
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,640
It's about 22 kilometers big.

223
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:15,840
And it's one of the most developed regions in Italy, and it's a choice for others and

224
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:27,520
a kind of light on administration of other regions.

225
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:39,800
Our area is very important for economic growth and industrial growth and tourism.

226
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:48,240
So we have a lot of products to eat, and you know Italians are very, very careful about

227
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
food.

228
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,880
So this is a big amount of food.

229
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:03,320
But also it's a very good area of industrial growing about motorsports.

230
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:18,000
Since ages, since tens of years, we developed a lot of very informed and very famous examples

231
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,120
of very good industrial products.

232
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:45,840
Because of this, the administration of the region must be aware, like the private sector,

233
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:54,040
and so the administration must accomplish their business.

234
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:04,760
It's a very hard duty because companies are always asking for good results.

235
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:13,280
For this, because of this, we have started doing analytics a lot of time ago.

236
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,200
It's more than time ago, 10 years ago.

237
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:31,840
And nearly since 2013, we started using Pwik, now called Matomo.

238
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:42,920
And the question was providing the privacy for the users.

239
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,560
Just that.

240
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:55,160
The only different product we can use was the Google Analytics, but we were not happy

241
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:05,360
with it because if you follow the previous talk, it was explained that free services

242
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:16,600
from private companies are always expensive in terms of privacy, it's a privacy cost.

243
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:28,600
So in 2013, we migrated our system from a barely logs analytic measurement to a real

244
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:43,480
web analytics software, because Pwik at that time was already giving a better amount of

245
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:52,080
data, a better amount of data, because of its scripts, because it was open source, a

246
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,560
very cost stable.

247
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:04,240
That happened before the JDPR rules that come in 2018.

248
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:13,920
And so we were already sensitive about this kind of problem of the privacy.

249
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:22,560
And our database size is now about 100 gigabytes.

250
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:31,480
And the most of the data is the report tables we are collecting since the start.

251
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:43,320
We have a lot of data we collected since 2013.

252
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:59,280
During the last two years, all the world had an emergency problem with the global, the

253
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:12,040
problem of the social problem with the virus.

254
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:23,200
And we started from a situation we can see here in the starting point where all the visits

255
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:32,880
to our website were about sleeping, about like sleeping, but they weren't really sleeping.

256
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:43,720
This is what our bigger amount of visits about this event was called the regional election

257
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:52,320
day that happened in the middle of January of 2020.

258
00:30:52,320 --> 00:31:02,360
And then we had the problem with the emerging problem with the national security and the

259
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,520
health of the people.

260
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:15,240
At this time, Italy was the first country in Europe hit by the health problem.

261
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,440
And Emilia-Romagna was one of the regions first hit.

262
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:30,680
And so this was the amount of data we collected by people visiting our website looking for

263
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:39,920
the source of the official information for their life.

264
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:49,120
And this amount of data was also growing in the months later.

265
00:31:49,120 --> 00:32:01,240
And then we expected doubled the traffic on our websites during 2020 and during this year

266
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,160
and this is not yet ended.

267
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:10,040
And so I think we are going to get the same level of visitors.

268
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:17,760
You see, you can see that the level it's really doubled in these two years.

269
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,720
And that's because people was looking for information about their health.

270
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:33,320
And also they discovered that our website is, all the websites we have are filled the

271
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,200
body a lot of useful information.

272
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:46,200
They weren't where I forgot to say, sorry, sorry for messing up with the slides.

273
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,520
I'm very sorry.

274
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:59,360
During that time, I was watching the analytics and I was careful about this small live recorder,

275
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:11,380
visit recorder and it was like this meme, I was watching these numbers going on.

276
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,760
This is now our installation.

277
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:28,480
Our installation is based on two virtual machine who are behind there under load balancer.

278
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,440
And we run the cron jobs for making reports every two hours.

279
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,240
Every two hours we have a cron job.

280
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:46,840
And this is the workload of the two instances.

281
00:33:46,840 --> 00:34:00,280
The blue line is the memory amount used by Matomo and the red line is the CPU load.

282
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:09,080
This is smaller than the past because of the PHP 7 upgrade.

283
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:17,400
And this wave is the average request per second.

284
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,360
This situation is not really optimized as you've seen.

285
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:30,360
You can run Matomo on containers and I think it's the best solution to do it.

286
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Because you can go with a cheaper configuration and spend less than needed.

287
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:51,320
This is needed because we are in a situation where we are not aware how much spikes we

288
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
can afford.

289
00:34:52,320 --> 00:35:03,880
But this configuration was enough to enjoy this roller coaster mountains.

290
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,440
So let's go on the plugin development.

291
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:20,520
We are contributing to Matomo and for the audience for more than five years.

292
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,840
It's nearly 10 years long we are doing good with Matomo and the community.

293
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:36,640
So you can see me sometimes in the forums helping and chatting with people.

294
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,360
And during this time we managed to public two plugins.

295
00:35:43,360 --> 00:36:01,840
One of them is a plugin that makes a measurement of people coming from intranet.

296
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:08,640
Your internal location is pretty configurable by the console, the administration console.

297
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:27,800
And you can choose your sectors, your addresses and by simple digiting regular expression

298
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,400
you can get this report.

299
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:44,640
This is important because our internal colleagues wanted to make a measurement of internal audience

300
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,480
and external audience on the websites.

301
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:59,720
I forgot to say we are measuring more than 150 websites.

302
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:12,520
And we have about 200 users managing and reading the analytics.

303
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:25,720
And so you can find this plugin, this plugin you can find it on the Matomo marketplace.

304
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:36,360
But also you can find this on the catalogue on the public administration catalogue in

305
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
Italy.

306
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:52,120
This is important because you say in the past, as you see, as you have seen in the past talks

307
00:37:52,120 --> 00:38:04,520
by Claudio, there's a lot of effort making the local administration publishing their

308
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
software.

309
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:15,160
When they are asked to publish open source software online and make it shareable with

310
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
the public.

311
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,920
And so this is part of our contribution and this part of contribution is also available

312
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:33,160
to other public administrations also and also in the shop in the Matomo marketplace.

313
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:41,320
The second plugin, the second plugin is not a dating plugin because I had a small amount

314
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:49,560
of creativity in that day, but the name of this plugin is the user dates, it's not a

315
00:38:49,560 --> 00:39:05,880
dating plugin, but it means that you can control the user behavior inside the Matomo.

316
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:15,960
You can omit them, you can avoid them making custom range reports because this kind of

317
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,740
reports are bloating or overloading the application.

318
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:31,280
So we chose to let them visit only pre-recorded reports and stay stick to there.

319
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:39,880
To make this, you must accomplish a small modification of the user interface and so

320
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,400
this plugin makes you do it.

321
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:53,400
We have also a personal team we use inside, but I don't feel, I don't felt what was interesting

322
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,360
because it's very easy to develop your plugin.

323
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:09,840
During these days and during these years, I've said, we also contributed to the development

324
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,880
of Matomo.

325
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:27,360
In the darker box, you can find a small amount of pull requests I've asked in the past.

326
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,640
And also, there are many, many issues I raised in the past.

327
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,960
I think this kind of contribution is very important to the community and it's very

328
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:53,360
important to the health of Matomo because it makes the audience, no, makes the core

329
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,080
developers aware of the audience.

330
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,920
Sorry for my bad English.

331
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:13,120
And if you want to learn Italian, just joking, you can visit the Italian section of the forum,

332
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,200
but it's not very crowded.

333
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,240
It's only, it's just the Italian part.

334
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:30,600
Also if you are engaged to Matomo somehow, I would like to suggest that you to participate

335
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:40,880
a lot more on the forums and also participating, exposing your wishes and your problems on

336
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,720
the issue on the GitHub.

337
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,360
And for now, my presentation is ended.

338
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,080
And now I think it's a good time to make a question and answer.

339
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:11,360
So I would like to pass the live to Marcus and let's go with the question and answer.

340
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Thank you.

341
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:18,320
And thank all of you three for the very nice presentation.

342
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,120
So if anyone has any questions, please write them in the chat.

343
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:28,880
There have already been some questions, but if I didn't miss any of them, I think most

344
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,280
of them have already been answered.

345
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:41,360
So but if there's any new questions, I'm just gonna wait once again a minute to see if anything

346
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:56,840
pops up because it's late.

347
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:06,080
Well during the speech, I was starting some questions from the audience.

348
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,120
And one of them was a question for David.

349
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:22,000
They asked if your service, Web Analytics Italia, is a fork of Matomo.

350
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,640
And they also asked if you made also a personal team.

351
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,720
And another question was, I don't know, and I think there are no many questions.

352
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,680
If you have developed any plugin also.

353
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:48,920
Thank you, Pierluigi, I just answered all the questions in the chat during your presentation.

354
00:43:48,920 --> 00:44:03,440
So I think there is no need to repeat my answers and to leave room if there are more questions.

355
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,920
There's one question that just popped up, which is, have you seen any other countries

356
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,960
contributing to Matomo as well?

357
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:19,640
Well, I know other countries are using Matomo and I know also the European Commission is

358
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:26,440
using Matomo, but I don't know if they are contributing in the sense of making plugins

359
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:34,040
or participating in the community.

360
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:42,720
Thank you.

361
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,840
I think I'm going to call it once again.

362
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,400
If there are any other questions, the chat is going to stay open and you can still ask

363
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,400
questions there.

364
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:03,320
Yeah, and with that, thank you once again for your presentations and have a great afternoon.

365
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Thank you.

366
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Thank you so much.

367
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:33,320
Goodbye.
