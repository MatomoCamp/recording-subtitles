1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Okay, and with that, I'd like to start the next talk.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,440
It is once again going to be a talk by Thomas Persson, and I'm once again going to do a

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,440
small introduction.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,600
He is a business developer at Digitalist Sweden, and he has worked with Tracking Digital Analytics

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,720
since 2010, and has been a contributor to open source since 2007.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,040
Tracking SBA applications is something that often leads to bad data and frustrations.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,840
In his talk, Tracking SBA Applications with Matomo, Thomas wishes best practices and demo

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
how to make it work.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Thank you.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,520
All right, thanks.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:56,720
Let's see how this goes, fourth presentation for two days now, hope my voice don't crack

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
too much.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:07,160
All right, so yeah, generalists and working for Digitalist, we are an open source loving

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:14,640
organizations that provides expertise around Matomo, for instance, we sell a SaaS service

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,760
and help our clients with consulting around Matomo.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,040
We're also developing plugins for Matomo.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:32,000
So in this presentation, I will talk about single page applications, and let's start

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,720
by answering the question, or actually, it's not me answering, I think it's a Google in

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,880
this case, or a Wikipedia descriptions, but what is a single page application?

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,800
So let me read it out loud, a single page application is a web application or a website

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,920
that interacts with the user dynamically, rewriting the current web page with new data

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,000
from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entirely new

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
pages.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,680
So what does this really mean?

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,560
Let's look at the next page.

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:17,640
And hopefully, we can see a little bit of an example of this little video we play.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,200
So in this case, this is a single page application, and what's significant here is that we're

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,560
rewriting the page in comparison to this one, you can see that the whole page is reloading

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,720
and you can see that little refresh, I'm going to do it again.

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,080
So up on the left hand, you can see that now we're not reloading the page, we're just quickly

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,480
rewriting the URL, but it's not really happening, but when I switch to the Matomo org website,

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,680
we can see that the actual whole page gets refreshed.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,840
So that's the main difference where we're dynamically loading data into the browser

34
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,020
without actually refreshing the browser in the traditional way.

35
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:13,280
So examples of frameworks for single page applications are Angular or React or Vue.js,

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,700
there are a lot more examples, but these are probably the biggest three frameworks.

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:27,440
As you might know, Angular is used in Matomo to create the widgets and we're actually switching

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,960
over to Vue now, which I think is a nice move.

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,080
So I think that is supported from 4.5 and I've seen that the interface has been starting

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
to be rewritten in Matomo.

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,880
So actually when you go into the Matomo interface to load different reports, you can actually

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,840
see a single page application in place.

43
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,400
We are refreshing Matomo's interface without actually reloading the whole page.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:06,080
All right, so when it comes to tracking these applications or working with them in general,

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,480
it requires us to, because page views is kind of the fundament of web analytics or the internet

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,840
or the web, I should say, not the internet, but the web is basically based on page views

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,160
and links and since we don't really have that, we need to fake these page views.

48
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,760
Normally, when you refresh a page, you have a browser event called page view and that's

49
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,720
actually what we refer to when we track page views.

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:47,800
So instead of doing that, we need to use another event happening in the browser when we reload

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
the page.

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,240
So if I go back to this little page and I click on the link, we can still see that this

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
one has changed the URL.

54
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,920
So we are having an event called history change and that's the event we will start using instead

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,200
of the traditional page view event.

56
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,880
Yeah, an application can look like this.

57
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,120
You start to create a URL structure that matches a real website, but you're not really refreshing

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
the website.

59
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:28,240
One example is to add the hash sign and then apply new URLs and it's more correct to call

60
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,280
it a context in the application than a real URL, but in this case, we're not having the

61
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:42,720
hash but we're actually rewriting the URL so it looks like a real URL.

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,820
So basic tracking in Matomo has to be done differently.

63
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,680
So instead of using the traditional page view event in the Tag Manager, we need to use the

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,480
history change event.

65
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,720
I will demo this soon as well.

66
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,760
And of course, you will need to add the Tag Manager script to your application and then

67
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,800
you create the standard tag of the type page view, but you use the history event instead

68
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,220
of the page view event.

69
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,800
So let's have a look at how that might be displayed.

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,040
So I actually have both examples here in this setup.

71
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,760
I have this one which I call the just page view and we have a trigger called page view

72
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,840
on this one and then I have the virtual page views or virtual page views and here I'm using

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,760
the trigger called history change.

74
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,640
So if you're familiar with the Tag Manager, you can go into the traditional one and we're

75
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:50,200
having a trigger here and if I edit this trigger, it's of the type page view and nothing really

76
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
different there.

77
00:06:51,200 --> 00:07:04,880
But for this page view, I'm having the history change event and let's go and look instead.

78
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,800
Let's just start from scratch.

79
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,880
If you have an empty container, you need to click this one and you actually have an event

80
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,800
further down here prepared in the Matomo tag when you call the history change.

81
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,120
So you can just use that, give it a name and start using it.

82
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,720
I want to create a duplicate here because I already have it in place, but that's basically

83
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,920
what you need to do.

84
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,360
Depending on how well your single page application is written, you might end up in different

85
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,320
problems and I will talk a little bit more about that, but first look at the example

86
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,500
we have here.

87
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,840
So I actually have the tracking going on under the hood.

88
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,360
So when I click on different URLs here, you can see in my network console that I'm actually

89
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,520
sending data to Matomo.

90
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,920
So let's see what happens.

91
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,460
I will refresh and look at the visitor log for my particular instance.

92
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,920
So what you can see here is that I'm actually getting the full URLs and it seems like I

93
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,600
get the tracking going on when I just switched the context and I also have some title coming

94
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
in here.

95
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:29,520
So depending on what I'm looking for, beach, beach pictures seems to be matching this and

96
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
the URL.

97
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,920
So that seems to correct, but actually this application wasn't really written in a correct

98
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,840
way from a web perspective.

99
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:45,280
So I had to do some customizations to get this to work and we look into what that is.

100
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:55,760
So by default, when I send the page view, you can, yeah, actually the first page view

101
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,760
is the normal tracking and let's have a look at that, the page view and oh, sorry, I should

102
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,880
look at the tag.

103
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,000
So looking at the page view, you can see that the title and the URL is something we can

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,160
tweak, but I don't do that right now and that means that by default, Matomo will just fetch

105
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,040
the page title, which is a head attribute up here.

106
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,160
So the page title is SPA demo, which is this one up here.

107
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,520
But when I click the different URLs, it seems like the page title is never changed.

108
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,700
It's constantly saying just SPA demo.

109
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:53,440
So to manage that and to get correct reporting, as I actually have down here, you can see

110
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,800
that the title is likely changing.

111
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,200
I have to do some custom configurations because the application is not correctly written.

112
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,720
The correct way for the developers to do this would actually be to rewrite the page title

113
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,120
on every new load, but that doesn't happen.

114
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:23,400
So in my virtual page view, I fix this by having a look, I've created a custom variable

115
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,560
and I actually read the H2 element into that variable instead.

116
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,800
We also have to fix this in a virtual page view.

117
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,720
We have to fetch an element called the history hash new URL.

118
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,560
And this is actually a built-in variable in the Matomo Tag Manager.

119
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,920
Further down here, you have a lot of history related variables that you can use.

120
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:02,680
So in this case, the hash new URL, this one, I think it is, history new URL, yes, actually

121
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,640
contains the new rewritten URL.

122
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,160
So that's nice.

123
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:16,520
If I don't have anything, sometimes I've seen applications where you don't really have a

124
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,480
correct title that you can actually read or an element on the page.

125
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,560
One thing you might want to do is to just get the last piece of the URL and send that

126
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
as a title.

127
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,880
So you at least get something more correctly describing the page.

128
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,040
And to do so, you would create another variable and read the last part of the URL and send

129
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
that instead.

130
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,920
But in this case, I could use the H2 tag.

131
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,800
We can have a look at that one as well.

132
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,840
So I'm creating a variable of the type DOM.

133
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,520
And with a CSS selector, I can just pick H2 and it will read it out.

134
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,560
You obviously have to test this for your site because actually a page can have multiple

135
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
H2.

136
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,680
So it could be a bit dangerous to just do it that way.

137
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,200
But for this particular case, it works pretty well.

138
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:27,760
So common challenges, as I said, the new page title is not set on history change.

139
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,800
Sometimes we don't even have URLs rewritten at all.

140
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,240
You might have single page applications that doesn't rewrite the URL.

141
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,040
But you still want tracking.

142
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,680
Maybe the only thing being rewritten here is the H2.

143
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,040
In that case, you could actually fake that as well.

144
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,400
I would go to the tag because sometimes you just want to understand how users behave even

145
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,640
though your application is poorly written.

146
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,280
So in that case, you could go in here, you could use the H2 and send that in as a URL,

147
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,480
for instance, to at least fake or simulate that you're tracking the correct behavior.

148
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,920
The best way is, of course, to ask the developers to rebuild the applications.

149
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,280
But sometimes that will take time or be able to do in a few months or something like that.

150
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:29,800
So it can be a quick workaround to actually set it up in your application.

151
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:40,160
Another thing that can be a bit tricky is event tracking because sometimes these applications

152
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,600
are dynamically reloading and it's hard to do it in a traditional way.

153
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:57,200
So in more advanced examples, I've actually been setting up, let's see, let's see where

154
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:06,960
I have that, these are the configurations, yes.

155
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,560
So this was actually written in Swedish, but that doesn't matter.

156
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:22,320
But you can actually do that by pushing, this requires more advanced setups, but in some

157
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,960
cases, you have so much logic going on in your single page application.

158
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:35,240
So instead of controlling all these things in the Tag Manager, you rather set up custom

159
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:44,360
events in the Tag Manager and just waits for your application to send events like this

160
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,960
on the left side and push data into your single application.

161
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,600
This is also the way to do it with custom events.

162
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,560
So if you're, for instance, having forms submitted in your application or something like that,

163
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,760
you can actually ask your developers to use this MTM push event, custom event, it would

164
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,800
say, and then you would send event category name and actions and value into Matomo and

165
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,240
pick it up and post that.

166
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,960
I've been doing a few of those implementations as well.

167
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:35,240
Yeah, so let's see, no, that's not the correct description.

168
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,800
But actually, it was quite fast, this presentation.

169
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:49,640
Let's see if there are questions and open up for that.

170
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah, thank you.

171
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:04,640
So if there are any questions, please type them up now.

172
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:27,200
I hope that was to some use, at least I'm pretty sure it was.

173
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,480
There seem to be no questions though, at least up until now.

174
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,480
So let's do it the traditional way, I will be checking the chat.

175
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:47,120
So please write questions there and I will have a look and try to write it down.

176
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,440
The last tip could maybe be to, there is actually a single page application tracking guide,

177
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,320
because it can be pretty complicated.

178
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,720
Okay, so now we got one.

179
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:17,200
Ask the tag manager to capture custom variables, I guess, or I don't really, I don't know if

180
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I want to capture custom variables, you shouldn't actually use custom variables, but I'll show

181
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,640
you what to do in the configuration variable, you have something called custom dimensions.

182
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,520
That's actually the feature you should use instead of custom variables.

183
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,360
Custom variables are deprecated in Matomo.

184
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,680
So what you can do here is if you have a custom dimension, you basically set the index number

185
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:56,360
you have from creating it, and then you use the variable here to send whatever data you

186
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
want to send.

187
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,840
So if you have some meta tags on the page containing the tag of the page or whatever,

188
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,800
you can set custom dimensions this way.

189
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,840
So I hope that answers that.

190
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,640
He did add something to it, he said, to me, it looks like you're pushing custom variables

191
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
to tag manager.

192
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
So I don't know if that's specific.

193
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:32,640
But then I think I know what he means, because we're pushing to, how should I explain this?

194
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:41,640
You can, maybe I should actually do some drawing here too, but I don't.

195
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,840
So there are two ways to tag manager can actually, let's check, I can maybe do this example.

196
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,360
Let's create a custom event.

197
00:18:52,360 --> 00:19:04,960
We create a custom event called test, and we're actually getting the way to send custom events

198
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
down here.

199
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,440
So we can use this code.

200
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:21,040
So if we have the custom event called test, create a new trigger, and we can then execute

201
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,700
some code when this happens.

202
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:42,560
So let's create a custom HTML tag, and it's important in your coding, sorry, we should

203
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:59,600
do this, then we do that on the custom event called test, and we create a new tag.

204
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,320
So I'm just trying to explain the basic here.

205
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:14,640
So I will do that, I will go to the application, and I will open the console.

206
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,440
And now I can send this custom event, and we call it test.

207
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,360
And hopefully this will trigger my code firing the alert.

208
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,480
So in this case, I didn't send any data to Motomo, but we can actually use the custom

209
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,800
events here to send whatever data into Motomo and handle it.

210
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:44,080
So this would actually be what your single page applications fire under the hood.

211
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:55,360
So if you go back and look at my application here, I would do something like this.

212
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:10,000
So in this case, I have a custom event called custom page view, and I'm setting these two,

213
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,680
I need to create these variables to catch this.

214
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:24,120
But I can fire this to Motomo, and then I need to have a custom event, custom page view event,

215
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,560
and then I can set up two variables that with data layer variables called custom URL.

216
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,480
Let's try this and see if I can do this.

217
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:42,160
Let's create a custom variable called, it should be of the type data layer, custom URL

218
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:56,520
like that, and then we need to create a custom title, so I will create a data layer variable.

219
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,200
Where do we have it?

220
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Here we go.

221
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Custom URL.

222
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Okay.

223
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:14,040
Oh yeah, I did not already create it.

224
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,640
I forgot that it was a title I was supposed to, okay, it didn't copy and paste correctly.

225
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,400
Do it again.

226
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Custom title, now it's correct, variable.

227
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,400
So now we have these, we have a trigger, we need to create the trigger called custom page

228
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:55,040
view, so create a new trigger of the type custom event like this, or custom page view.

229
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,800
So now I have a trigger that can listen to this.

230
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:07,920
And lastly, now I want to set up a new analytics type, I will send a page view, I will pick

231
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:19,480
up my custom title and my custom URL, and I will fire it on the custom page view event

232
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:41,400
that I will manually fire, create this tag, publish it, and then I will go to my page

233
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,320
and just reload it so I get the new version of the Tag Manager, and then let's just go

234
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,600
back to history and let's see if this works.

235
00:23:50,600 --> 00:24:00,160
If I go to the network console now, I should have something collecting this, maybe I didn't,

236
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,760
oh yeah, there it is.

237
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,720
Let's look at the tracking later on as well.

238
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,280
My URL and my title.

239
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:15,040
So going to the single page application now, I've been actually able to, yes.

240
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,120
So here we have it.

241
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:30,080
So looking at the application again, this is what you would do, you will have your single

242
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,880
page application control this instead of doing it in the Tag Manager basically.

243
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,160
So you're just having this middle layer taking care of the data and sending it.

244
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,400
The same solution would work for event tracking.

245
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:53,760
In that case, you would create another tag of the type Matomo and you would go to event

246
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,560
and then create variables to contain category, action, name, and value, and then of course

247
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,240
create another event to listen to it.

248
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,720
That was maybe the more advanced example, but sometimes this is actually what you want

249
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:18,520
to do because single page application are often maintained and quite tricky and sometimes

250
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:25,480
you simply have better control of the event handling and the data in the application.

251
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,840
Usually in an application you have something called routing, for instance, and then it's

252
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,200
pretty easy to attach these functions into the application to get the page tracking correctly.

253
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,760
You could actually send page view data directly to your Matomo, you don't have to use the

254
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Tag Manager.

255
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,480
However, I prefer using the Tag Manager as a middle layer here because that gives us

256
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,920
the option to actually manage things in between, even though it's possible to directly send

257
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,520
page view data in, it's actually pretty nice to have this middleman because then if there

258
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,280
are problems, for instance, you can start writing exceptions or blocking things or whatever.

259
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,880
It's pretty nice actually to do it that way.

260
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Any other questions?

261
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Okay.

262
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Thank you.

263
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:26,680
We've got one more, which is, is the SPA event recorded as a page view?

264
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:36,200
The SPA event, okay, I think that was what I showed.

265
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:44,440
I hope that, so the event tracking was what was just displayed.

266
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Okay.

267
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Then hopefully it was answered correctly.

268
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,480
If there's still a question open, I'm pretty sure it's going to be asked again soon.

269
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,160
Yeah, there are new questions coming in now, so hang on.

270
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Yeah.

271
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Yes, seems to be the case.

272
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,880
Just a bit more typing.

273
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Nope.

274
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,480
If that's all the questions, then I would like to thank you once again for another great

275
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
talk.

276
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Thanks.
