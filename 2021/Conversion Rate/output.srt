1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Okay, now all looks good.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
Thank you for joining us today, Frederick.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,280
The floor is yours.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Thanks.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
So thanks, everyone, for being here.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,320
My name is Frederick, and I'm going to talk about Matamu, Converged Generated Simulation

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,600
today.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:33,920
Just as a reminder, you are able to join the chat room on the matamucamp.org website.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:43,440
Just go into the talk card, and you have the link to join the chat, if you ever have some

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,080
questions, I can answer it.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,420
Okay, so here is what we're going to talk about today.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,680
First of all, I'm going to introduce myself, then we're going to talk about the prerequisites

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,200
for doing Converged Generated Simulation with Matamu.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,600
Then we will talk about how you can find your first optimization ideas, then how you can

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:11,040
prioritize these ideas using some CRO frameworks, then how you can use Matamu UX analytics features

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,160
in the process, how to write your testing hypothesis, and how to make an A-B test using

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,200
Matamu testing features.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,000
So I'm a digital analytics and CRO consultant.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I've been working with several companies and several organizations in the public sector.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,800
I am specializing in open source web analytics for about two years now.

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:52,400
And I also was a pedagogical director of a digital marketing master, so I'm quite used

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,440
to teaching and building teaching programs.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,400
Here you can find my LinkedIn if you are interested.

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:13,080
Okay, so what do we need to do Conversion Rate Optimization with Matamu?

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,560
The first thing we need to do is to define what performance is.

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,280
So I have a definition here.

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,440
Performance expresses the level of achievement of the objective's pursuit.

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,000
So here is really something important to be able to know what we're talking about because

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,800
we're talking about something which is performance and it's really important to know what we

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,760
are meaning when we say performance.

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,040
So now we need to define the objectives, which means the business goal.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,840
First of all, I'm going to give you an example.

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,040
You may want to increase the part of people who will purchase one of your products if

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,960
you are an e-commerce website.

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,560
And then you need to define the level of achievement, which means the indicators, the thresholds

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,880
and the segments.

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,480
So for instance, for the e-commerce conversion rate, the indicator would be e-commerce conversion

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
rate.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,200
We could decide that the threshold is two persons and we could decide that this threshold

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
is for all users.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,400
And to keep going through this process, we will use two main tools.

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,000
The first one is the KPI framework.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,640
And the second one is the measurement plan and the tagging plan.

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:44,280
When you want to do optimization on analytics with tools like Matomu, you need to have as

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,920
many data as possible to have a granular analysis.

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,540
So it's really important to have a proper tagging plan and proper KPI.

47
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,160
So what is a KPI framework?

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,760
Basically, it's a document that explains how you're going to measure performance through

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,640
different level of engagement from a user point of view.

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,040
So you start, you always start with your business goal and in the scope of reach, the first

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,960
level of engagement, you want to increase the visibility of your sites.

52
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,840
On the level of engagement, you want to increase the number of qualified users on the platforms.

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,400
You may also want to engage the audience and you may want to develop the visitor base within

54
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,360
the digital ecosystem if you have several websites or apps.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,240
On the conversion level, you want to facilitate, develop the realization of actions having

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,320
a direct impact on the business.

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,600
And on the advocacy level, you may want to maintain and develop the relationship with

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
the site's audience, increase the number of contacts in the CRM, develop visitors from

59
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,840
social networks, and develop interactions on the community on social networks.

60
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:12,360
So for each of these business goals, here we are on a KPI level, which means macro indicators.

61
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,000
You have, you define here indicators.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,120
So for instance, for reach and increase the availability of websites, you want to increase

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,760
traffic volume.

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,400
Then you have the description of the metric, you have the Matomo metric, you have the threshold

65
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,120
and you have the source.

66
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,240
So here we're going to take a look at this part here, but it's really, it's really important

67
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:45,240
to have all the levels of customer engagement so that you know if your preferences is good

68
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,480
or not, for instance, on a monthly basis.

69
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,120
And here you also, you can see that sometimes you have a Matomo as the main source of data

70
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:05,000
and you also sometimes have external tools such as SEO tools and sometimes social media.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,640
On this document, there are some things that are missing, but I just wanted to show you

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,200
a big picture of it.

73
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:23,900
What is missing is the segment and what is missing is also the calculation of the indicator.

74
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,960
What you need after that is the measurement plan and the measurement plan is the document

75
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:37,400
where you explain what are all the actions you're going to track with Matomo, mainly

76
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,280
using event tags.

77
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,160
So for instance, here you have the page template and all the actions that the users can do

78
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,920
on this specific page template.

79
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,720
The type of tag feature you're going to use in Matomo and then the architecture of your

80
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,600
event category, action, and name.

81
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,960
So this is really important also because we are talking about KPIs, which means we are

82
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,680
talking about indicators that we will give to the top management, but sometimes you have

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:20,320
also marketing teams that want to increase the level of engagement and the level of some

84
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,440
events, some realization of events, so it's important that you list everything here and

85
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,560
that you can have that in your Matomo instance.

86
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,400
And once you have your measurement plan, then you can go on and write down your tagging

87
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
plan.

88
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,800
So here, this is the technical part where you tell the dev teams what type of codes

89
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,160
to push on the page.

90
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,640
So here we have the data layer for the events, and here you can see the tracking code and

91
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:01,960
all the different values that are pushed to the data layer.

92
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,840
And then last but not least, you also have to add all the different values you will be

93
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,760
using as custom dimensions.

94
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,400
This is really important also to have a really granular analysis and to be able to segment

95
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,480
all your optimizations.

96
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:30,800
Okay, now you have your KPI framework, you have your tagging plan.

97
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,160
You can start optimizing.

98
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,440
So we defined what performance is.

99
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,840
Now what we're going to do is define what conversion rate optimization is.

100
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,600
It's the name of what we are doing.

101
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:55,320
You probably know search engine optimization, all kind of stuff doing optimization, but

102
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,720
it's quite specific here because CRO is, I have a definition also, it's the practice

103
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,800
of increasing the percentage of user who perform the desired action on the website.

104
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,000
But I have a problem with this definition because I give an example below.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:24,720
If you suddenly drop your prices by, let's say, 90%, you will have a really good positive

106
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
impact on your conversion rates.

107
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,360
But that's not what you want because only increasing the conversion rate is not enough.

108
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,760
That's why I think we should talk about conversion volume and value optimization and not only

109
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,880
conversion rate optimization.

110
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,840
Okay, now we have defined what we will be doing.

111
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,200
How can we find our first optimization ideas?

112
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:01,440
I took the example of an e-commerce website because this is really an example where we're

113
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
talking about money.

114
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,640
So performance here is really simple to understand.

115
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,920
So when you have your indicators, you can compare the metrics between the different

116
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,440
segments and audiences.

117
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:23,480
For instance, we decided that our average conversion rate should be, let's say, 2%.

118
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,880
And when we compare the conversion rates by mobile desktop tablets, we see that there

119
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,800
are huge differences.

120
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:41,340
So now we should ask ourselves questions, which will be, why is there such differences

121
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,120
between devices?

122
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:52,160
In the real world, we know that most of the time, people make their first visits with

123
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,320
a mobile device and then finish the order on a laptop or desktop.

124
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,400
But here for the example, we will assume that people start their session, their visits on

125
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,160
the device and finish or don't finish the purchase process.

126
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,440
So here we see a huge difference between desktop and mobile.

127
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,540
What should we do?

128
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:26,200
We should go and look into the e-commerce sales funnel to see if we can see any difference

129
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,180
in the checkout steps between the different devices.

130
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:38,400
So what you're going to do is you're going to go in the funnel reports.

131
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,120
And here you have the different steps.

132
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,240
So here is authentication, sign up, payment, and conversion.

133
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,480
And what you want to do here is to use segments within Matomo and see if you see any difference.

134
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:05,120
And if you see any difference, then you may want to try to optimize.

135
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:12,840
If you see a huge difference, for instance, at the payment information step, let's say

136
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,880
for mobile users, you may want to investigate further.

137
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:25,360
But this is not what we are going to do now because we're going to see that at step four,

138
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,260
how to use Matomo UX analytics features.

139
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:36,080
Now we're going to continue and talk about conversion rate optimization frameworks.

140
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,560
Because we need to structure our approach doing optimization.

141
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,160
We could do what we call heuristic analysis.

142
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,040
Just a few words about what heuristic analysis is.

143
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,960
It's just you go through your websites, through your conversion journey, and you take notes

144
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,800
on what's wrong from your point of view.

145
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,760
You might say on the product page, I find that pictures are too small.

146
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,040
I think that the app to cover is not prominent enough.

147
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,400
It's below the fold, stuff like that.

148
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:21,160
You can also do some kind of benchmark with competitors saying, yes, on the product page

149
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
they do stuff that we don't.

150
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,480
And I think this could be a good idea.

151
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,480
But it's quite risky because, once again, this would be your own opinion.

152
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,080
And we are doing marketing, so our own opinion should not wait that much in our decision.

153
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,760
So that's the reason why we should rely on data and on frameworks.

154
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:53,240
So I gave you here, I'm not sure, three or four examples of CRO framework.

155
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,240
The first one is PIE, which is a model done by wider funnel.

156
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:08,320
In fact, you have marks here for every lift optimization zones.

157
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,920
And you have three items, the potential of the change, the importance of the changes

158
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,920
and the ease of the changes.

159
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,760
And then you will have a score here, and the higher the score is, the first the optimization

160
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,920
should be done.

161
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:38,120
Then you have another example of CRO framework, which is the ICE model, which was created

162
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,640
by Sean Ellis.

163
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Here again, you have three items, the impact, what will be the impact if this works, confidence,

164
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:55,360
how confident am I that this will work in ease, what is the ease of implementation.

165
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:03,040
But this here, I have a problem with it, how confident am I, since it's something that

166
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm going to propose, I think that I will be confident in it, but confidence is not

167
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,240
something really scientific.

168
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:25,080
So this exists, so this is good to know that it exists, but it's not something that I would

169
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,000
recommend to use.

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,480
You have also another model done by Hotwire, and here you have one point or zero point

171
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,380
for each item.

172
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:49,160
So let's say this optimization idea will support the companion main metrics, yes or no, one

173
00:15:49,160 --> 00:16:00,640
or zero, with the test as changed on the results of many pages, yes or no, again, one or zero.

174
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,280
Is it a change above the fold or below the fold?

175
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Okay, I'm not going to explain everything, but you understand the principle, one or zero,

176
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,200
and the higher the note, the quicker the test should be run.

177
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:25,480
And the last one, it's the PXL framework proposed by Conversion XL, and again, it's a mark notation

178
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:35,720
system with one, zero, or two, and the higher the note, the most important, the test.

179
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,360
So what you have to do when you want to do optimization is to go through the data, go

180
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:49,320
through the websites, and look for huge differences.

181
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:57,760
And once you find those huge differences, then you have to investigate further.

182
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,000
And when you want to investigate further, that's when UX analytics features come into

183
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,080
place.

184
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,360
You saw that in the checkout step payment info, it's really lower for mobile users,

185
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,640
but you don't know exactly what the issue is when you only look at statistical data

186
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
within Matomo.

187
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:35,080
So you may have an idea, but you have to confirm that your idea goes in the right direction.

188
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,600
So here is what you can use as features in Matomo.

189
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:48,040
Here it is examples taken from the Matomo demo website.

190
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,400
I think that you all are aware of what Session Recording is, but I'm going to just re-explain

191
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,360
it just in case.

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,580
What it does is that it takes video snapshots of users' journey on the website.

193
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:10,560
So it allows you to watch video playbacks of users' journeys on the website.

194
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,800
So for instance, on the example I took on the payment info, you see that mobile users

195
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,720
don't go through and don't finalize their purchase.

196
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:31,440
So you can ask Matomo to record this behavior, and then you can watch the playback just to

197
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,600
confirm your hypothesis that might be, I don't know, it's not mobile friendly or I don't

198
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
know what.

199
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,480
You can watch the videos just to confirm the idea you have about why it's not working as

200
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,480
it should.

201
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,680
So here just, again, a screenshot of what it does.

202
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:03,240
You have here the movement of the mouse on the page.

203
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:12,280
What you can use also as Matomo features for just to confirm your idea is to use the Itmaps

204
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,900
feature.

205
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:22,000
So imagine that you have this payment info page and you should click on the accept the

206
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,960
terms of sales, and you see that people don't click on it because it's not that visible.

207
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,800
So here the Itmaps will help you to confirm the fact that people don't click on it because

208
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,360
it's, let's say it's below the fold, it's not visible enough.

209
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,520
So that's the reason why people can go through the purchase process and maybe they don't

210
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,440
see it and they can click on the next button, so that's the explanation you have and it's

211
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,440
confirmed by the Itmaps.

212
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:08,000
Another interesting feature that you can use in Matomo is the form analytics feature, especially

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,640
when you are talking about checkout processes, just to make sure that there is no issue with

214
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,200
some specific fields.

215
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:28,360
For instance, you may see that some fields are left blank or there are some format issues

216
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,840
with some fields.

217
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:40,440
Here it's interesting to have also the information on the different forms and what type of issues

218
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,720
can occur on the different forms.

219
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,000
Last but not least, the user feedback plugin.

220
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's a quite new feature.

221
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,100
It allows you to ask feedbacks to users using the Tag Manager.

222
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:08,520
So if you have that user or mobile user that's in the payment page, payment info, who is

223
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:18,480
about to leave, you can use an exit page trigger and then present to this person this model,

224
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,080
saying, okay, what went wrong on this page?

225
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,880
What could have we done to make it work?

226
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,840
This is quite interesting.

227
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:45,000
There was, I guess it was this morning at 9, there was a conference held by Thomas Pearson.

228
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,440
I encourage you to watch the playback of this session because this is really interesting

229
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,160
because it's all in Matomo.

230
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,600
It's not an external tool.

231
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,360
You have all the feedbacks in Matomo.

232
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,960
You have the completion of the feedbacks that can be sent as events.

233
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,240
So this is really something you could take advantage of to better understand what's going

234
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,920
wrong on our pages.

235
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,800
Okay, so now you have your optimization ideas.

236
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,560
You have sorted them by priority.

237
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,400
You have collected more info with UX analytics features and you can describe the issue more

238
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,360
accurately.

239
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,280
So as I said before, for mobile users in the payment info, the accept terms of stay button

240
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,960
is not visible enough.

241
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,200
You saw that on the session recording because you saw that the mouse moving and not clicking

242
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,560
the button.

243
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,320
You saw that also with the events you prepared on your tagging plan for mobile users to see

244
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,480
the click rate of this button is really low.

245
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,480
You also see with the hit maps, you also saw, sorry, with the maps that people don't click

246
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,160
on it, which makes the next button inefficient.

247
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:14,360
You can click on next to go through the purchase process.

248
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,480
So these users don't understand what's wrong and they leave the page.

249
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,560
So now you are able to write down your test type of this, and this is really important

250
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,640
when you want to do A-B testing.

251
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,800
You should use this pattern if I, and here you describe what you are going to do on the

252
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:43,480
page, then users will, and then you describe the change you expect in user's behavior.

253
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:53,600
So here, if I make the accept terms of sales button more visible in checkout step payment

254
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:01,120
info for mobile users, then they will click on it and be able to go to next steps and

255
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,080
complete their purchase.

256
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,920
This is what you think is going to happen when you make the change.

257
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:22,800
Once you decide that it's your hypothesis, you will design a page and you will redirect

258
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:29,880
a certain amount of people to this page and the other will go through the regular page.

259
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,760
You will want to check if there is any difference in the performance, the performance being

260
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:43,680
the E-commerce conversion rates, and you can start configuring your Matomo A-B test feature.

261
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:53,760
But before that, you should use a simple size and duration calculators because if we want

262
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:03,320
tests to be statistically significant, we need to make sure that we have some requirements.

263
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:11,760
For instance, here, with 3% conversion rate with 95% confidence level, 80% statistical

264
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:20,800
power, and minimum 50% conversion rate lift and three variants, the calculator says, okay,

265
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:32,440
if you want that to be statistically significant, you need to have at least 23,000 sample size

266
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,280
per variant.

267
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:44,960
And also here it gives you the length that the test should be and here for the minimal

268
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,800
detectable effect you would see in the duration of the test.

269
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:59,120
So once you have this, you know that you have, you need to have this level of sample size,

270
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,420
this test duration, then you can go on and start configuring your A-B tests.

271
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:11,440
So I recommend that you follow each step on the Matomo interface for that.

272
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Okay, you give a name to your test.

273
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,120
Here you write down your test hypothesis.

274
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,640
Here just the description of the test and the number of variation that you will have

275
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,560
and then again the target pages.

276
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,800
Then you, sorry, I guess it's the same, no, it's not the same.

277
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,000
Here you go through the success metrics.

278
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,040
Matomo will suggest you some metrics that you could use as a success metrics, but you

279
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,760
can decide to use totally different metrics.

280
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,160
Here you give the success conditions.

281
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,040
So here the minimum detectable effects you want to have.

282
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:11,000
By default it's 15%, but you can write a different number, but it's, yes, it's a minimum.

283
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,160
The confidence threshold is most of the time for all A-B tests, so it's about around 95%.

284
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,320
So just leave it as it is most of the time.

285
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
It's okay.

286
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,240
It's just something that says it's the probability that the result will be the same over the

287
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,520
time.

288
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:39,400
It says, okay, this is not due to a random result.

289
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Here you have the target pages.

290
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:52,280
A visitor will enter the A-B test when and a visitor will not enter the test when.

291
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,120
Here you have the traffic allocation.

292
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:04,000
So here you have 100% of people going through the test, but it's not, it won't be that level

293
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
most of the time.

294
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,040
Here you have the, again, the traffic allocation for each variation, each, let's say, template

295
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,200
page template in the test.

296
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:30,800
And here you have the URLs of the different pages.

297
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:39,240
Here you have the start and the end of the page, of the test, sorry, and the code you

298
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:47,120
have to put in your page to make the test active.

299
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:59,260
And here I put a screenshot of an A-B test example coming from the Matomo demo website.

300
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:10,120
So when you wrote down the hypothesis in the interface, here it's going to be reproduced.

301
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:17,760
Here you have the description and all the performance metrics.

302
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,240
Since how long the test has been running.

303
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,540
And here you have the overview of the test.

304
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:35,360
So you have the conversion rate for each variation, the original and they apply now.

305
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
So we have an average conversion rate.

306
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:44,720
And here we have the difference between the two of them and the detected lift.

307
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,320
So here, since we have the statistical significance of 100%, we have a clear winner, which means

308
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:59,280
that on this test, when you say if we change the top CTAs on the individual job page to

309
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,280
be an action about the job, more users will apply to the job.

310
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:11,760
So the hypothesis was good because we see here that there is a real difference in the

311
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,800
way people acted over that call to action.

312
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,400
Okay, so I'm done.

313
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:31,000
Maybe I was a bit quick, I don't know, it's 1.35.

314
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,720
So if you have any questions, just feel free to ask them on the chat.

315
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:51,240
I'll be happy to answer.

316
00:30:51,240 --> 00:31:12,880
Okay, so I don't see any questions.

317
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:25,560
So since there is no question, I propose to stop the recording and to end the session.

318
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,400
Many thank you for this interesting session, Frederick.

319
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,600
I guess people might be feeling a little bit shy now, but of course, the chat room will

320
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,980
be open.

321
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:45,520
So everyone, you can also continue the conversation there if you want to discuss further with

322
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,720
Frederick about this session and what was discussed here.
