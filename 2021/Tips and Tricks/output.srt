00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello. So, I started the recording. So, since it's 10 a.m., we're about to start with this

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:23,680
session. Today we have Richard Stark, who is a Matomo Supporting Member and Matomo Analytics

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,080
Expert. In his talk, Matomo Tips and Tricks, he will tell us more about the collection

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:37,320
of Matomo features which you might not know about. So, let's hear Richard for more.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,180
Good evening from New Zealand. Thank you, everybody, for joining this Matomo Camp session

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,980
for Tips and Tricks. All right. So, for those of you who've never heard of me before, hi,

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,660
I'm Richard. I am part of the Matomo Support Team based here in New Zealand. For those

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,840
of you who maybe have sent us some emails over the past couple of months, maybe a year

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,380
or so, you might have seen my name pop up in your email inbox, maybe now and then. So,

10
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,100
if this is not the first time, thank you so much for joining us. If it is the first time

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,760
hearing about me, it's great to meet you all. All right. So, as you saw in the previous

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,800
slide, my session for today is titled Matomo Tips and Tricks. I've really tried to include

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,960
a bunch of different tips and tricks for everybody, kind of from the everyday users of Matomo,

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,040
as well as tips and tricks for those responsible for managing the Matomo setup or for Matomo

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,720
administrators. All right. So, I've broken down the tips and tricks into four different

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:48,640
categories. They are, number one, UI tips. Number two, performance tips. Number three,

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,160
useful CLI or command line interface commands and how to figure out what options to use.

18
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:02,040
And number four, useful free plugins that are not installed by default in Matomo. And

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,280
then at the end of the session, we'll have a short Q&A session. So, please feel free

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,480
to pop any questions you might have in the chat room during the session. We do have a

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,160
dedicated chat room available for this live session on chat.matomocamp.org. I have asked

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,480
the moderator to grab a few of the more interesting questions to answer at the end just to make

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,720
sure we don't miss any of those. But you're also more than welcome to repeat your questions

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,360
at the end if they do get missed. If we do have enough time, we'll also be opening up

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,920
the floor to any questions at that time that you may have just randomly. So, let's get

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,120
started. Number one, we've got some UI tips. So, the first tip I've got for you today is

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,600
called Zen Mode. So, for those of you who have never used Zen Mode before, what it basically

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,240
does is it provides you with an uninterrupted view of your Matomo reports or your Matomo

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,080
dashboard. And it can be really, really useful for situations where you want to have a dashboard

30
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,880
on a dedicated screen or a dedicated vice for sharing reports. For example, if you might

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,880
have a dedicated screen in your office for looking at dashboards or pretty numbers and

32
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,720
charts, that is the perfect thing to use for this. It can also be quite useful if you wanted

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,600
to embed, for example, the entire Matomo UI into an iFrame. So, toggling Zen Mode on and

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,780
off can then allow you to quite easily navigate between the different reports within the iFrame.

35
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,240
And then when you want to bring that into sort of the full screen mode, you can quickly

36
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,840
toggle the Zen Mode and you have that awesome uninterrupted view of your dashboard or for

37
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,720
your reports. So, if you've never seen what the Zen Mode looks like before, I will get

38
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,960
to show a screen which hopefully a lot of you are familiar with. This is what the standard

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,760
UI in Matomo looks like. I'm pretty sure this is something that a lot of you see probably

40
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,980
on a daily basis, maybe less so often for other people. But what Zen Mode basically

41
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,840
does is this. It gets rid of the top menu bar. It gets rid of the menus on the left

42
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,640
hand side. And in the screenshot here, I've kind of added the screenshot including the

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,000
URL bar at the top. But obviously, if you did want to have this on a nice big screen,

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,280
you can go into full screen and you can have that really awesome uninterrupted view of

45
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,440
your Matomo reports. So, if you've never used it before, there's actually two different

46
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,760
ways that we can get to Zen Mode, how we can toggle it on and off. So, the one option,

47
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,960
of course, is to just click on our small little toggle button at the top of the page over

48
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,040
here. The other option, which is my preferred option, is just to hit the Z key on your keyboard.

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,280
That allows you to quickly switch between Zen Mode on and off.

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,200
All right. So, my next tip for you today is the search function shortcut. So, the search

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,040
function shortcut helps you kind of quickly navigate within the Matomo UI using your keyboard

52
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,680
and keyboard arrows. So, what it does is it allows you to search for and switch between

53
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,240
websites and segments quite quickly without having to touch your mouse. It also doubles

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,080
as a search tool to look for more information on the Matomo.org site. For example, you can

55
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,200
quickly search up for user guides or maybe you have a question or two that hopefully

56
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,800
is answered in an FAQ. So, most of you have probably seen the search bar up in the top

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,700
left hand side of the Matomo UI before, but if you wanted to quickly access this search

58
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,920
feature, you just hit the F key on your keyboard.

59
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:37,000
All right. The next UI tip for today is themes. So, for those of you who've kind of used

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,440
Matomo for a long time and have never really tried themes before, it's really something

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,480
that you can use to kind of customize the look, the feel, and the layout of the Matomo

62
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,160
UI. There are actually several different themes available pretty much for every Matomo user

63
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,760
in the world that you can quickly install and activate on your Matomo to get a really

64
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,360
custom looking field. So, some of the default ones you can see up on the screen now. For

65
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,200
example, we've got modern, we've got the minimalist themes, we've got the dark themes, but then

66
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,240
we also have some other themes that are specific just to customizing fonts. Some that give

67
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,680
you really cool visualizations, some spark lines, things like that.

68
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,120
The really great thing about themes, though, is that you're really not just limited to

69
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,760
these few themes that are available. The themes are completely customizable. You can customize

70
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,240
them to your heart's content, and it really requires very little skill. If you have a

71
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,000
basic understanding of CSS or maybe a little bit of less, you can customize as much as

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,600
you want and then upload those themes directly to your Matomo UI. So, if you've never installed

73
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,600
or activated themes before, you're probably wondering, how do I download and install themes?

74
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Now obviously, we can have a look on the website directly at themes.matomo.org, but you can

75
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,120
also directly have a look at the themes from within your Matomo UI. So, to do that, we

76
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,560
just go to the administration icon, we go to platform and marketplace, and then we click

77
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,240
on the drop down menu and we select themes. From here, you can select any of the themes

78
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,200
that are available to download, but you'll also have a nice little button up at the top

79
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,560
of the screen that lets you upload your custom themes in a zip file format that you can then

80
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,600
install and activate on your Matomo instance.

81
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:40,920
Alright, the next section is performance tips. So, one of the biggest performance improvements

82
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,720
that you can make to your Matomo instance is to disable browser archiving and then set

83
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,760
up a crontab for archiving. So, you might be wondering, why do we recommend disabling

84
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,120
browser archiving? Now, for the majority of users out there that have very small websites

85
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,540
or websites that might have only a few hundred visits a day, it's definitely not worth the

86
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:11,380
effort going ahead and setting up those crontabs and disabling browser archiving, but for those

87
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,360
of you that are tracking a little bit more, you know, maybe a few thousand hits a day

88
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,560
or maybe tens of thousands of hits a day, this is probably one of the biggest improvements

89
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,600
that you can make to the performance of Matomo that you can see very quick and tangible results.

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,240
So, when we have browser archiving enabled, almost every time a user views a report, Matomo

91
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,280
needs to process the report that they're trying to request. It needs to go and fetch all that

92
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,480
raw data, needs to crunch all the numbers, needs to put everything into pretty charts

93
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,700
and numbers and lines and present it onto the screen. And it does this on the fly or

94
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,640
basically in real time. So, you can imagine if you're loading a report that has a lot

95
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,480
of data or reports that cover a long period of time, this can sometimes really slow down

96
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
your experience with Matomo and can sometimes take quite a long time for those reports to

97
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:17,600
load. This sort of effect can really be compounded when users are not aware of this. And it,

98
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,560
you know, they might be going around jumping through a bunch of different reports wondering

99
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,480
why the heck is this thing taking so long? What I mean there by compounding is if a user

100
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
clicks on one report, it takes three or four seconds to load and they don't see anything

101
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,960
on the screen. They decide, hey, I'm going to have a look at this report. That report

102
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,960
does the same. They can go through five or six or seven different reports in a matter

103
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,520
of seconds and every single one of those reports, once you start loading them in the user interface,

104
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,760
those requests have already been sent. The Matomo server is working on them in the background

105
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,880
to try and process all that data. Now, the good thing is, is when they go back to those

106
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,100
other reports that they've already requested the data for, it should load relatively quickly.

107
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,660
The problem is if they come back and do that again in one or two hours later, it's going

108
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,040
to need to do that whole process over again. So by pre-processing all of those reports

109
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,960
using what we call a crontab for the core archive command and setting up a schedule

110
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,020
and disabling that browser archiving, we can be a hundred percent certain that all of those

111
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:28,760
reports can load really, really quickly and your Matomo users can have a great experience.

112
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,040
So this setting can actually be changed directly within the general settings of your Matomo

113
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:42,240
instance, but it can also be set up by setting the specific config setting in your config.ini.php.

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,840
But of course, if you're not familiar with messing around with the files directly on

115
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:53,080
the Matomo server, disabling this within the UI is just perfect. All right. It is still

116
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,680
important, however, to understand that there are going to be some cases where Matomo will

117
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,780
still need to process reports when they're requested from the browser. This is specifically

118
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,580
important when you're requesting, for example, a date range report because a date range report

119
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,400
cannot be pre-processed. The other thing as well, if you have users who have created segments

120
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,920
and those segments have been configured to be processed from in real time or on the fly,

121
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,200
those segments will also be triggering some browser archiving requests. All right. The

122
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,760
next tip that we've got for you has to do with segments. So what we talk about with

123
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,560
segments when it comes to performance is we're talking about how far back segments are processed

124
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,600
by default on your Matomo server. So when you have a segment in Matomo, if you're creating

125
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,360
a segment or editing a segment, the default that Matomo is going to process that segment

126
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,620
for is what we call the beginning of time. And that basically means that Matomo is going

127
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,420
to process that segment from the very first day that you have raw data. Now, for a lot

128
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,360
of people, this can mean that they're having to process segment data going back two or

129
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,420
three or even more years, five or six years into the past. So this can have a really big

130
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,640
impact on performance, especially for those people who have a lot of historical or a lot

131
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:33,520
of raw data. So by changing this to a different time frame, for example, you can change it

132
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,240
to automatically process only back 30 days. You can do it for 60 days or three months

133
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,600
or six months or even a year. You can really customize and prevent your Matomo server from

134
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,040
working too much on reports that you might not need to use. So to change this setting,

135
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,880
we basically need to add the following to our config file. Now, if you're wondering

136
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,440
how the heck are you going to remember this, all of this information is available. You

137
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,080
can have a look in your config file. You can have a search for it on the Matomo website.

138
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,140
You can hopefully find some more information about how to set this config file. Otherwise,

139
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,560
if you wanted to look for this specific one, you can maybe take a screenshot or have a

140
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,960
look at this recording afterwards, and then you can implement this into your config file

141
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,600
settings. And of course, like you can see in the slide that's on the screen, there's

142
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,840
a few different ways that we can set this up. For example, the one at the top is the

143
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,260
segment creation time. So basically that means that no historical data for that segment is

144
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,320
going to be processed from before the date was created. So for a lot of people that are

145
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,240
tracking maybe tens of thousands or even millions of hits every single month, this might be

146
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,200
the most beneficial one. You can also have a smaller timeframe. For example, the one

147
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:57,140
at the bottom is the last 93. So that's roughly about three months historical data. So now

148
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,560
that I've told you how to disable browser archiving and to change how far back Matomo

149
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:11,300
goes back to process all of the segment data, you're probably wondering how do I get historical

150
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,080
data when I've configured this setting in Matomo? And that brings us really nicely into

151
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:24,560
our next segment, and that is useful CLI commands. Now, CLI is an acronym for command line interface,

152
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,940
and that might sound really scary, but Matomo, when you install it onto your server, has

153
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,000
a really cool what we call the console script. And the console script allows you to run some

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,800
really specific commands directly on your Matomo server that allow you to do things

155
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,160
or accomplish tasks that you want to do. So we've got a couple of different CLI commands

156
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,040
that we're going to talk about today. We're going to talk about how to invalidate specific

157
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,040
date ranges. So this is very useful for archiving specific segments further back than what we've

158
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,080
just recently changed in our settings. We're also going to have a look at invalidating

159
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,640
specific segments. And then number three, which is something that you might not have

160
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:15,320
been aware of, is invalidating specific plugins. So if you don't know, Matomo 4 actually ships

161
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,380
with a new feature that allows plugins that support that new feature to automatically

162
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,000
archive reports going back a certain number of months. So for example, if you've just

163
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,480
installed a brand new plugin or you've just purchased a premium plugin and you go ahead

164
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,560
and install that onto your Matomo server, the great thing is that Matomo is going to

165
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:43,280
go back and automatically archive the last six months of data for that new plugin. So

166
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,200
that means that you have instant access to a great wealth of historical report data for

167
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,260
that new plugin. However, sometimes it's still going to be necessary to archive reports going

168
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,320
further back than what we've just set up in our settings. This is especially useful when

169
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
you just installed a plugin. You want to have a look at, you know, what was the data for

170
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,560
this plugin a year ago or two years ago or even further back than that, as far back as

171
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:20,520
what you have raw data. So that is when the core invalidate report data console command

172
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,940
comes in. So as you can see in the example on the screen, in this example, we're running

173
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:32,520
the invalidate report data console command. So this command always requires a dates option.

174
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,980
As you can see in the example, we've got, for example, from the 1st of June up until

175
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:44,880
today. So that will basically invalidate all report data for your entire Matomo instance

176
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,560
going from the 1st of June till today. You can also use other types of date formats such

177
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,760
as the last 30 or last 7 or last 90, you know, things like that to kind of just get a general

178
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:05,760
date range invalidated. So some of you, if you're having a look at this, might be remembering

179
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,440
that we do have what we call the invalidate reports plugin. That also allows you, as you

180
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,920
can see in this example, to invalidate segments. The biggest difference, of course, between

181
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,680
the plugin and the console command is that the plugin is kind of like what we would consider

182
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,600
a sledgehammer when you're trying to invalidate report data. It doesn't necessarily differentiate

183
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,560
between different specific dates or specific plugins. It's kind of an all or nothing deal.

184
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,480
And that's where it really comes in handy, knowing how to work with these CLI commands.

185
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,880
And you can combine a lot of these different options together to get some really specific

186
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,520
ranges or specific report data that you're looking for. So as you can see in the example

187
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:00,040
over here, we've just put the plain text name of our segment. And in the next one, you'll

188
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,360
see that we can now also invalidate some very specific plugins. So this is really where

189
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:14,600
the CLI commands are a lot more useful than just invalidating report data in the UI. So

190
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,160
when we combine all of these together, we get the ability to not only invalidate reports

191
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:29,440
for a specific date range and for a specific segment, but also for a very specific plugin.

192
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,160
So this is really, really useful. And once you've done all this, of course, it then becomes

193
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,400
necessary to reprocess that data. And that brings us to the very last step in this specific

194
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,200
section. And that is reprocessing the report data that we've just invalidated using the

195
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,600
force date range option. So in this example, we're looking at the last one that we used,

196
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,200
the core invalidate report data, where we set the dates as the first of June to the

197
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,460
last of June. And when we run this last core archive command with the force date range

198
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,040
similar to or exactly matching what we've just invalidated, Matomo is going to only

199
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,880
go ahead and process that specific date range for that specific plugin. So some plugins

200
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,880
do actually have their own console commands that can be used for archiving, which we'll

201
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,480
talk about in a minute. But what a lot of you may be wondering is like, oh, do I have

202
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,000
to take a screenshot of this page? Do I have to memorize all of this information that's

203
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,840
in front of me right now so that I know how to use it? And the great news is no, you don't

204
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,640
have to memorize or take a screenshot of any of this data because all of this is directly

205
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,200
available when you run the console commands directly on your Matomo server. And we can

206
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,240
find this information by using the dash dash help option that the dash dash help option

207
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,640
when you're working with CLI commands is your absolute best friend. If you've ever forgotten

208
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,920
what the specific command is or what type of input you need to give for a specific option,

209
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,280
the dash dash help option is going to show that. So here, for example, in this slide,

210
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,280
we've got the help output for the core archive command. So as you can see on the screen,

211
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,600
hopefully the text isn't too small. We can see all of the potential options that we could

212
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,280
add to this to kind of really narrow down and get some very specific commands that we

213
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,040
can use for our server. So as I mentioned earlier, we do have some plugins that might

214
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:45,160
have some very specific commands. A good example of a plugin that has its own archiving command

215
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,640
is the custom reports plugin. So with the custom reports console command, it allows

216
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,280
you to actually go in and specifically just archive the custom reports for a specific

217
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:04,000
date range without needing to first invalidate that data. Now, a lot of you might be wondering,

218
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,640
do I need to have a look at that? Do I need to go look at a guide for that sort of information?

219
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,200
And here's the next really great tip is that no, you really don't have to know that information

220
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,400
beforehand. The console command, if you just type in console on an SSH or in a terminal

221
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,120
window in the Mitoma root directory and you add the dash dash list option, it's going

222
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,840
to give you a full list of all of the console commands that you can run directly on your

223
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,460
Mitoma server. And now that you've got this great list of console commands, you can then

224
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,200
run those specific commands each with their own dash dash help or dash help option to

225
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,140
get a list of all the optional parameters or required parameters that that specific

226
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:56,120
plugin requires. So the important thing to remember whenever you're working on this thing

227
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,680
is that just because a command works on one Mitoma server doesn't necessarily mean that

228
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,640
it works on every other Mitoma server. And the reason for this is that every plugin that

229
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,120
you install has the ability to add options to that list. So in other words, we're talking

230
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,200
about all of these console commands can be or are in a lot of cases server specific.

231
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,240
So if you're ever curious about how to run these console commands, how do I figure out

232
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,000
how to use all of this stuff, use the list command, use the help command and build your

233
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,020
command from there. Alright, so our next section is going to be useful free plugins and these

234
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:43,760
are specifically plugins that are not installed in Mitoma by default, but are available to

235
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,000
be downloaded and installed directly from within your Mitoma instance without requiring

236
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,840
any additional information. All you basically have to do is click download and install from

237
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,400
your Mitoma instance. And we're going to start with the first one on my list at least and

238
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,320
in my opinion, one of the best free plugins that you can install called the Queued Tracking

239
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,440
plugin. So the Queued Tracking plugin, it improves the performance and the stability

240
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,920
of your Mitoma server by reducing the load on the Mitoma database during tracking. It

241
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:27,720
also at the same time really greatly improves the speed of tracking requests sent to your

242
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,560
Mitoma server. So how this works does take a little bit of an explanation. So we're going

243
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,840
to do that now. So hopefully you'll see a graphic on your screen and what we're looking

244
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,560
at here is what we would consider a normal tracking request. So you can see up at the

245
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:49,040
top there, the browser sends that HTTP tracking request. That tracking request then gets received

246
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,040
by the Mitoma server and needs to be processed. It's then inserted directly into the Mitoma

247
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,000
database into that raw visits log and then once it's inserted, we send that response

248
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,000
to the browser. Now the Queued Tracking plugin, this behavior changes in a few key ways. So

249
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,320
as we can see on the next graphic, as soon as the Mitoma server, so here at the top again

250
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,640
we can see the HTTP tracking request. As soon as that is received by the server, it's put

251
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,180
into a queue and then immediately the Mitoma server responds to that browser or to that

252
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,480
device or that application to say, great, I've got that tracking request, you can carry

253
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,780
on. Once that tracking request is then placed into the queue, there's a few different things

254
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,720
that can happen. Now, number one, you can either set up your Mitoma instance to automatically

255
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,000
process all of the requests that are in the queue when the queue reaches a certain threshold,

256
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,440
but it can also be set up to be run on a schedule. So for example, you can process all of the

257
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,880
requests in the queue once every minute or once every two or three minutes. And what

258
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,480
this really does is that like you saw in the beginning, it not only improves the tracker

259
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:12,740
performance, but it also enables your Mitoma server to handle very large traffic peaks

260
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,000
without bringing down your database server. And the way that it does this is that instead

261
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,480
of sending, you know, small little individual single tracking requests every single time

262
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,500
one of those tracking requests is received to the database server, it can process all

263
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:33,480
of the tracking requests in that queue as a batch tracking request. So it really helps

264
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,720
your Mitoma server and it really makes a lot more stable and capable of handling those

265
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,080
very large tracking peaks.

266
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,760
All right, the next one on the list is the tracking spam prevention plugin. So the tracking

267
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,600
spam prevention plugin gives you some really good options that you can enable to prevent

268
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,040
spam tracking requests being sent or logged in your Mitoma server. So it does this by

269
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,640
giving you a couple of options. The first option it gives you is blocking requests from

270
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,160
cloud providers. So this is really useful, for example, if you have a malicious or a

271
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,440
bad actor that's sending you a lot of tracking requests from a server somewhere specifically

272
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,920
in the world. And the problem might be that they're using a lot of different servers,

273
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,380
you can't block all of those IP ranges. Well, the great news is the tracking spam prevention

274
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,840
plugin is going to really help you in that.

275
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,600
Number two is that it can automatically block requests from headless browsers. Headless

276
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,320
browsers are notorious for people that try to send these sorts of requests because the

277
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,760
load that it puts in the device sending those requests is a lot lower than a fully fledged

278
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,940
browser.

279
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:53,360
Number three, it can restrict the number of actions in a single visit or the maximum number

280
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,560
of actions that Mitoma will track in a single visit. This is especially useful to prevent

281
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,600
spam visits that might or that can sometimes track hundreds or even thousands of actions

282
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,360
in a single visit. We've seen some examples with people that we've provided support to

283
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,400
in the past from the Mitoma team, where they've had individual visits tracked over 10,000

284
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,880
actions in a single visit in a matter of minutes or even hours. And the great way is that you

285
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,440
can automatically block this or cap the number of tracking requests that can be tracked in

286
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,800
a single instance.

287
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,640
And number four, it can exclude specific countries or it can allow you to only include specific

288
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,520
countries. So this is really useful. For example, if you have a website that is specifically

289
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,680
targeting or specifically only working in a single country or in a single group of countries

290
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,840
to automatically exclude any tracking requests from countries outside of that, but it can

291
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,960
also be useful to very quickly and easily exclude specific countries if you notice that

292
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,680
you're getting a lot of spam or non-legitimate tracking requests from those countries.

293
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,560
All right. The next plugin on the list, which is an absolute must-have, is the marketing

294
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:20,080
campaigns reporting. So by default, Mitoma will give you the option or will give you

295
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,360
the ability to track campaigns. And it comes with a really useful campaign URL builder

296
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,360
directly in the Mitoma UI. However, a lot of people, or let me rather say, most people

297
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,480
probably already have campaigns set up that they're using to drive traffic to their site

298
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,720
using campaign links that are oftentimes set up in their ad networks or with specific social

299
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,000
networks. And the marketing campaigns reporting plugin extends that default capability, that

300
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
default campaigns reporting, to give you access to all of the possible campaign parameters

301
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,840
used by these platforms, as well as providing support for some of these campaign tracking

302
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,020
parameters without needing to use any of the Mitoma-specific campaign parameters. We have

303
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,560
a really great blog post available on our blog that you can go and read up about the

304
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,560
marketing campaigns reporting, and I would definitely recommend installing it on your

305
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,880
Mitoma server. All right. The next one on the list is probably a little bit more for

306
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,060
the Mitoma administrators out there. So that's called the Log Viewer. So the Log Viewer is

307
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,200
kind of more just a quality of life or convenience plugin that you can install to have a quick

308
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,440
look at the Mitoma application logs. So this can really save you some time and effort instead

309
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,840
of having to SSH into your server and grep some logs or download your logs from your

310
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,920
syslog server, you can just log into Mitoma, go to your administration UI, and have a look

311
00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:01,240
at the logs directly. All right. And the next one on our list is the Custom Alerts plugin.

312
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,720
So the Custom Alerts plugin is really great, especially if you're not somebody who's looking

313
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,160
at the reports every single day. And what the Custom Alerts plugin allows you to do is

314
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:19,960
to get notified when something changes or something specific happens in your Mitoma

315
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,160
instance or on the websites that you're tracking. For example, you can set up an alert when

316
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,840
your website gets more than 300 views in a day. You can have another alert set up, for

317
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,280
example, if a specific product sells less than 100 items in a specific timeframe. But

318
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,760
alerts can be set up in other ways as well. For example, you can set up alerts as percentages.

319
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,760
So you can set up an alert, for example, that notifies you if the traffic to your website

320
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,720
drops by more than 50 percent in a given timeframe. And obviously, a 50 percent drop over a given

321
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,840
timeframe probably indicates that something big has changed or something has happened.

322
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,320
You can also set it up for if you have zero visits. Now, obviously, zero visits would be a pretty bad

323
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,640
outcome for you. You want to be sure that you're getting all of the tracking data and

324
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,640
that nothing is wrong with that tracking data. So for those types of alerts, you can actually

325
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,920
set them up not only as an email alert, but also as an SMS alert. So if you're setting

326
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,560
up an SMS alert, you'll need to make sure that you also set up the Mobile Messaging

327
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,080
Plugin. Now, the Mobile Messaging Plugin is included in Matoma Core, but it might not

328
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,480
be activated on your Matoma server. So if you want to set up SMS alerts with a Custom

329
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,520
Alerts Plugin, you'll need to go ahead and activate that plugin as well. And the last

330
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:53,040
plugin on our list for today is the IP2 Company Plugin. This one kind of explains itself.

331
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:00,400
What it does is it adds the functionality to your Matoma server to easily see if visits

332
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:07,880
to your website or app are connecting from any known IP ranges for specific companies.

333
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,320
So this is really useful, especially if your website or even your marketing campaigns are

334
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:20,160
specifically targeting a certain market segment or even a very specific company. It also provides

335
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,080
you some reports for these as well, so you can see which companies are visiting your

336
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,640
website or using your application more than others. And all of these plugins can be found

337
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:39,320
on the Matoma Plugins website at plugins.matoma.org. There is a massive list of plugins that didn't

338
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,960
make the cut, unfortunately, for this session today. So if you're ever curious, if you wanted

339
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,800
to know how you can extend the capability of your Matoma server, have a look at the

340
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:56,080
list of plugins available there. And alternatively, you can also find them in the Marketplace

341
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,360
section of your Matoma server. From there, you can directly install and activate and

342
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,680
start using these awesome plugins. All right. And that brings us to the end of the last

343
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,240
segment for this Matoma Camp session. So we're going to move on to some question and answers

344
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,400
now. So if you haven't yet had an opportunity to send some questions through to the chat,

345
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,360
just going to take a minute. The moderator has sent some questions through to us on the

346
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,280
chat on this side as well. So we'll just have a quick look through those questions and see

347
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:37,100
if we can answer some of them. How is it like to work for the Matoma or InnerCraft team?

348
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:43,220
This is a question from Ronan. Honestly, it's been probably one of the best work experiences

349
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,260
that I've ever had in my life. The team is amazing. It's awesome to work in a group of

350
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:56,240
people that are conscious about open source software, conscious about being open and sharing.

351
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,140
And it's really just a great company culture overall. What are the next big features the

352
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:10,200
team is working on? So yeah, there's not a lot of big secrets when it comes to what sort

353
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,660
of features we're working on. If you want to know what features we're working on next,

354
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,940
you can probably have a look at the GitHub issues page. And you can kind of see, kind

355
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,060
of looking at those milestones in the GitHub page, you can kind of get a feeling of what

356
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,960
features are going to be worked on next. What is the priority for those sorts of things?

357
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,680
Can we add new shortcuts with Matoma? This is actually something I'm not 100% sure. And

358
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,620
I don't think we have the option to have keyboard shortcuts, but that's definitely something

359
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:48,700
that I'll have a look at and ask the team about as well. Do we have any plans to develop

360
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:55,260
more documentation about how to make more attractive teams? So I'm not sure who asked

361
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,740
that question specifically, but we do actually have a developer's guide available on our

362
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:08,940
developer documentation on how to create themes. Obviously, there's not necessarily very specific

363
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:16,100
examples of what you can do. The main reason for that is that it's kind of really open.

364
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,220
If you know a little bit about CSS, you know a little bit about LESS, you can go happy

365
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,700
and hack away all day every day and create really cool customized themes. Something that

366
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,540
I may not have mentioned earlier is that you're not just limited to using CSS or LESS, you

367
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:40,020
can also include JavaScript files in your plugins to kind of extend it even further

368
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:49,540
than what CSS or LESS would allow you to do. All right, Lenaro asks in the chat room, does

369
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:58,620
the spam prevention work retroactive to filter out already made spam visits? No. So the tracking

370
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,320
spam prevention plugin doesn't work retroactively. So this is something that you would need to

371
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:11,260
install to prevent future spam tracking requests. If you do have very specific spam tracking

372
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,820
requests, the best way to get rid of that data or those spam tracking requests is to

373
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,740
use the GDPR tools available within Matomo. And that can be kind of useful, especially

374
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,660
if they've, for example, all of the tracking requests came from a certain IP address or

375
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:35,220
if they came from a certain country or they track certain specific things to your Matomo

376
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,380
instance, you can use those GDPR tools to very quickly and easily delete all of that

377
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:49,700
data. All right, that's some of the questions that we've got on the, are we having any plans

378
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:57,100
to make the config.ini.php file accessible from the UI? No, I don't think we've got any

379
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:04,100
plans to make that config file editable from within the UI, but it is possible to view

380
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:12,340
the config file from the UI. Not necessarily just limited to the config.ini.php, but there

381
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:17,180
is a section under the diagnostics tab that you can actually go and have a look at all

382
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:25,060
of the settings that are currently set either in the global config file or the config.ini.php

383
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:30,460
within your Matomo instance. The reason why we wouldn't necessarily make it directly editable

384
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:38,100
from the UI is because a lot of the settings that you set in the config.ini.php can override

385
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:48,060
some of the settings that you might set in your user interface. All right, just having

386
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:54,620
a look for a couple more questions. Do you have any tips for solving upgrade issues?

387
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,620
Sometimes the upgrade fails and the database and core are not the same version. There have

388
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:04,460
been several questions on this in the forum, but there isn't a good solution. That's a

389
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,660
really great question and it's actually something that I helped one or two customers with in

390
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,180
the last couple of weeks as well. It might be really useful from our end just to put

391
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,540
that into an FAQ. It's something that I've kind of been planning to do as well, but yes,

392
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,140
there is actually a way that you can roll back the version that is stored in the database

393
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:30,740
so that Matomo can rerun all of those database upgrade commands. So stay tuned. I don't know

394
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:37,180
if you have any way that you can kind of keep an eye on some of the FAQs. Otherwise, feel

395
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:43,760
free to shoot us an email at support at matomo.org just asking about that information about those

396
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,100
specific steps. And if we don't yet have that FAQ out there, we'll be more than happy to

397
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,980
send that information on to you. Could you give a general definition of what archiving

398
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:03,720
means? Yeah. So archiving is basically the process that Matomo uses to kind of process

399
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,580
all of that raw data. So as you can imagine, if you're sending hundreds of thousands of

400
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:16,180
tracking requests or hits to your Matomo interface, that data on its own isn't really useful other

401
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:22,940
than just to kind of look at in reality. So what archiving does is it takes that raw data

402
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:28,780
and it parses through every single piece of that raw data, and that is used to then generate

403
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:39,480
the reports that you view in your Matomo instance. All right. Anyone else got a couple more questions

404
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:56,540
for us? All right. That looks like all the questions for today. So that means that we're

405
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,200
actually almost out of time. I really just wanted to say thank you, everyone, for joining.

406
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,780
Thank you so much for the awesome questions that you asked. I hope that everybody learned

407
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,680
something new today that will help give you success with Matomo. And I'd also like to

408
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,640
give a massive thank you to the volunteers that have made Matomo Camp possible. This

409
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,460
really is a community-driven event, and none of this would be possible without the awesome

410
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:29,700
contribution of the volunteers as well as the sponsors. Have a great day, everyone.

411
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:38,220
Bye.
