1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,050
the higher one a sorry for the

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,770
smaller delay and so it's currently

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,090
when or for the idea to go

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,450
up to her probably fourteen or fourteen

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,040
fifties or something like this

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,940
i feel free to ask as many

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,994
question as you can and shut that

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,370
metal candle on this song presentation is

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,040
a bit special because it's not oriented

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,630
towards let's say technical sings about matter

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,540
more nasal but the software that same

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,890
guess probably the only

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,310
conference talk which is about the business

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,950
so you miss the oh okay that's

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,160
kind of a dirty subject and so

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,890
on and so forth but iracing that's

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,980
it said one of the quiche issues

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,870
which are dealing with that we've met

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,490
tomorrow which is about how to make

20
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:03,000
a community growing and and one kissing

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,190
abouts are making and community growing

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,740
of course are to get attention from

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,740
the outside and one let's say one

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,040
nixing witches out of getting attention is

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,470
how you can make a living out

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,690
of metal and wholesome individuals can make

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,590
it more like a business job opportunity

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,200
and then have good reasons to walk

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,030
on a day to day basis an

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,460
unmet tomorrow let's said how's it can

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,990
move from the trencher that there may

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,330
be not love into a job that

33
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,570
they love dealing with free software which

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,788
was my case of course when they

35
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:45,840
started as an entity

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,390
as i was mustang walking with proprietary

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,360
solution now such of course as the

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,640
one off of google but thanks to

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,890
the business opportunities i got i get

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,860
the possibility to switch from google analytics

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,160
solutions and others to have full activity

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
around national

43
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,250
and that's three what this conference is

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,880
about it's about my feedback about hoi

45
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:15,840
succeeded in developing business opportunities based on

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,400
matter more and as what what i

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,920
observed and ashamed about what was our

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,930
companies are doing what he talks and

49
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,180
what doesn't and that of course i

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,950
you as an individual all

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,340
your company can take an advantage from

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,620
and may be sancta this feedback helped

53
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,680
to develop more products and services based

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,110
on matt moore and and have as

55
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,490
well afterwards contribution to and multiple community

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,160
saw that myself or my name is

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,260
a whole naushad enough i'm a

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,646
digital marketing trainer about met one eight

59
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,470
since two thousand and ten back at

60
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:53,160
the time

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,800
is there more than a decade ago

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,190
matter more wasn't the software that it

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,320
is today so i have to say

64
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,880
that i've been probably one of the

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,870
pioneer oh that's an unnatural to weaken

66
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,940
the time in order to stop developed

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,310
the business on it i made the

68
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,650
choice of not developing an agency of

69
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,340
still staying

70
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,310
one business in order to nuts that

71
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:20,370
said be trapped into a system into

72
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,080
an environment in which i won't have

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,150
any control over my company anymore

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,390
i had the chance to what faith

75
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,300
looks about digital analytics to be honest

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,070
i wrote three about the google analytics

77
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,600
one about the google tag manager and

78
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,060
one about piwik p rica being one

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,500
of the first that they that they

80
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,770
published it unfortunately did not get the

81
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,054
attention that they expected back then and

82
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,150
the now

83
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,250
the attention that it was in two

84
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,990
thousand and eleven when i wrote it

85
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,065
wasn't the same as today i guess

86
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,710
the two they're probably if i was

87
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,060
asked to write it it would be

88
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,970
of course from a consequence and we'd

89
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,524
probably get far more attention than than

90
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,980
guts back then

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,780
feel confident enough to

146
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,820

147
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,800

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,020
was back then in two thousand and

150
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,820
ten when the market wasn't the one

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
which she is nowadays which is of

152
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,480

a su practitioner saw such an entity

170
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,440
myself and i was walking for web

171
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,000

the website that we deliver in order

189
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,770
to be more let's say a privacy

190
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,560
compliant or in order to align with

191
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,230
the mission of what free software about

192
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,910
and this is where i discovered that

193
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,620
there was a technology which wasn't him

194
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,020
the week i added the time people

195
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,670
within the web agency which we are

196
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,120
passionate enough not to deploy a piwik

197
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,750
instance to say a several running p

198
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,270
weaken it and then because we had

199
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,309
the sovereignty because we were starting to

200
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,799
deliver some website with p we concluded

201
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,840
within it that they got the irish

202
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,120
because i was upswing charge of publishing

203
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,440
content on the web agency's website ok

204
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,780
why not just creating a landing page

205
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,150
in which i will announce that we

206
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,683
are delivering a training about pb kinetics

207
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:56,790
that all the time i didn't even

208
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,010
know about sorry just stuffed with a

209
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,000
bet that we judge

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,730
just sent in the lake in order

211
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,160
to say something which wasn't true i

212
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,880
have to say now

213
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,720
that's a real emergency and we deliver

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,330
trainings about matter what it takes

215
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,440
and i did that with several technologies

216
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,240
i did it with a w stats

217
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,250
i did it with the open web

218
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,710
analytics which for some time has been

219
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,960
a competitor offer of met one that

220
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,940
he takes up and one day the

221
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,770
phone rang and it was one of

222
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,650
the biggest company in france who was

223
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,600
on the phone we haven't really smaller

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,500
agency we're dealing with really like small

225
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,200
clients in in my own town so

226
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,840
and this french multinational company just caught

227
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,580
us and sell care we saw on

228
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,530
your page that you are delivering to

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,380
be reconnected to training we want you

230
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,756
on board we want you to

231
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
come in fairyland a false which is

232
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,900
like the biggest the business center in

233
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,630
france you're going this tower under the

234
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,330
fifth floor under the fifties floor and

235
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,850
you go and make the training while

236
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,830
i dunno for you guys for the

237
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,360
people who know what's up

238
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,990
met tomorrow looks like more than ten

239
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,420
years ago by twas while not like

240
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,550
the fanciest product to show on us

241
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,530
and the yet to deliver training about

242
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,690
it and the thing is that during

243
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,820
the training what was even funnier is

244
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,620
that we went we didn't have an

245
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,500
internet connection the training that i did

246
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,660
was probably probably

247
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,010
one of the worst that they will

248
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,500
develop but the thing is that ice

249
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,160
chest so much about it that i

250
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,590
have to train myself on the pi

251
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:43,560
week analytics documentation of the times when

252
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,900
people go talk that they get enough

253
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,670
you know they'll write a book about

254
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,620
it and then i went to a

255
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,610
publishing house

256
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,220
edition that's already walked with a nice

257
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,640
okay look or discontent material that can

258
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,200
make it boot camp out of it

259
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,180
and this is how the story starts

260
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,580
so i just out with it that

261
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,970
we will be client nick pressure big

262
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,117
contracts and then enough itself money not

263
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:10,980
enough to take a risk

264
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,940
sc which is about publishing the contents

265
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,110
that i

266
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,200
that's it that they wrote that they

267
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,960
made over my weekend's volume so this

268
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,010
is this is hoyt walks

269
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,330
then i got this book which of

270
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,920
course in the mind of people makes

271
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,260
you like a super style whereas i

272
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,030
have to said it's i didn't get

273
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,460
many scientists from around one thousand of

274
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,880
of of books i've been sorta dealing

275
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,820
with with pb kinetics and then what

276
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,260
i did from two thousand and twelve

277
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,310
to two thousand and four

278
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,070
ten and you know i was still

279
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,320
walking with proprietary solution and i was

280
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,140
still frustrated that the week was nuts

281
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,050
let's say getting that much attention so

282
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,450
i decided to create two websites in

283
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,210
order to attract some leads i started

284
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
to walk i gave some conferences here

285
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,500
and there it's hard

286
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,380
me make me more confident about talking

287
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,690
about the software i started tuning can

288
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,000
be more with the communities i've been

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,282
involved into a measure camp i dunno

290
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,950
tional measure comforts kind of the biggest

291
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,140
analytics community that you can find on

292
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,270
us i started to spread the world

293
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,576
about that measure camp and

294
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,720
i started twelve more leads dealing with

295
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,360
the with the time it wasn't in

296
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,970
the week and it was really making

297
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,670
me confident and it was worried the

298
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,380
kind of kids that they wanted like

299
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,930
the well will they'll seize the project

300
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,410
well very empowering and i want every

301
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,820
little that i got make

302
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,180
me as a more comfortable and what

303
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,980
do you make me realize that's appropriate

304
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,559
to establish an unjust to show you

305
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,720
in the forestry are not helping you

306
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,370
to educate yourself a bit though and

307
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,710
that free software is like offering you

308
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,310
far more possibilities in dem of learning

309
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,620
and education which which make them really

310
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,980
great

311
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,700
opportunities and in two thousand and fifteen

312
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,490
i set enough confident enough to say

313
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,070

of the free software and that two

317
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,160
thousand and six in particular already align

318
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,140
with what they want to do for

319
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,570

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,300
of many to nail the first contributor

375
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,770
to the net two one eight x

376
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,350
project that has been probably one of

377
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,470
the greatest experience that i got in

378
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,270
my career i got menus but this

379
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:42,510
one

380
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,470
really helped me a lot this morning

381
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,120
we go to reach our stock we

382
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,920
gave a conference to which i husk

383
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,720
what it is to walk up in

384
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,880
crofton and really what you said line

385
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,680
with what are you and what they

386
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,680
said i haven't been filed by the

387
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,600
company because you can see here that

388
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,660
i left the company in two thousand

389
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:03,780
and

390
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,340
and nineteenth just that's

391
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,800
you know cost is based and use

392
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,660
it and so it's a twelve i

393
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,910
will time zone of delay and it

394
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,520
was very exhausting on both sides i

395
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,580
mean like attending the conference by nine

396
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,450
pm in

397
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,920
like ons or twice a week is

398
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
very dramatic in terms of family life

399
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,930
balance and they came to a point

400
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,180
of doing this for like two years

401
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,970
walking with twelve hours of delay as

402
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,550
a socal i cannot continue destroying my

403
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,900
familiar life and has it been the

404
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,270
same thing for them to dissuade decided

405
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,720
to stay

406
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,970
i'm probably more helpful

407
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,480
staying in europe had been from you

408
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,256
up developing the met to one eight

409
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,550
six community to expand rather than being

410
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,530
into crafting but they have to say

411
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,340
that those two years have been extraordinary

412
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,720
you know they'll understand

413
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,940
what is the responsibility of owning software

414
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,609
such as metal noise and the from

415
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,800
two thousand and nineteen to now this

416
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,240
is what i said here i succeed

417
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,040
to double my revenue so to say

418
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,280
seventy thousand euros and i'm now in

419
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,740
fact helping partners around the world to

420
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,900
as well make a living out

421
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,560
of metal

422
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,440
this is the list of the different

423
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,900
services that they identified for by which

424
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,271
you can make a living out of

425
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,580
have met them all and i'm not

426
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,050
providing one of them that they have

427
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,140
some partners while delivering them so i

428
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,390
can of course so couple of world

429
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,700
about it so first one is about

430
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,740
to a boston which is mostly why

431
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,456
what's the agencies are providing then you'd

432
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:46,410
get the consumed king but which is

433
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,296
probably where else as a ruler to

434
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:52,470
do which is about solving complex issues

435
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,749
by solving complex issues i mean the

436
00:17:54,749 --> 00:18:00,030
measurement plan supports any issues and then

437
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,900
he takes things like

438
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,850
creating revolt and that kind of sing

439
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,760
training so training is ready to sing

440
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,310
that i'm i'm known for that i

441
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,410
liked the most to do but this

442
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,710
is a smart person or thing which

443
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,420
is about sharing knowledge about how to

444
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,420
use multiple than the first one that

445
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,940
identifies translation it

446
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,250
how did he have that happened to

447
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,320
me but that's possible to to do

448
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,960
it's about translating matter more and and

449
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,700
trust me is a lot to do

450
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,920
because it's a software which is evolving

451
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,230
a lot and the switches supporting like

452
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,830
almost forty two languages on us custom

453
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,170
development which is about how to create

454
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,220
something which does not

455
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,040
exist yet within metal and a six

456
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,830
one which is about writing documentation which

457
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,040
happen far more than we can we

458
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,960
can expect so little saw let's say

459
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,900
like six different services that they identify

460
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
and the idea to give you some

461
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,470
feedback about those so that you can

462
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,900
identify a little bit more about what

463
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,380
you could do

464
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,120
if she would like to expand your

465
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,800
set of services or if you would

466
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,930
like to sell and so he sees

467
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,810
based on the method that flip austin

468
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,150
and this is really what they said

469
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,980
most of the agencies are doing what

470
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,570
is great with web last thing is

471
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,240
that it brings content revenue so that

472
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,610
that's of course the most obvious thing

473
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,420
it's like

474
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,860
you did eva websites white nuts you

475
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,210
add to it

476
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,190
the possibility was well offer when you

477
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,360
sell your website to sell the weapon

478
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,210
at it's expected

479
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,810
it brings a lot of opportunity to

480
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,110
settlers of services and i'm quite amazed

481
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,900
to see that a lot of agencies

482
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,750
which shop or would you delivering website

483
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,110
we've met too including only about taking

484
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,750
this opportunity to sell more services on

485
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,250
top of it like consulting

486
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,460
because you don't truly need to be

487
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,750
like i mean you don't need to

488
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,390
have followed some unedited studies i mean

489
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,400
i did it myself but most of

490
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,780
the time when the client as an

491
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,420
issue seemed more of an issue with

492
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,420
nuts about understanding the data but which

493
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,130
is more about how the software is

494
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,650
walking how the us is walking which

495
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,400
means that's

496
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,245
emergency sinks that they cannot easily set

497
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,315
of consulting services because the things that

498
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:23,965
don't have the stuff tastes well as

499
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:26,335
definitely as it could because they have

500
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:27,865
a lot of different plans on which

501
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,995
to deploy matawan it so it means

502
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,945
that's the poverty they already have the

503
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:34,615
knowledge that they're unlikely and need but

504
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:35,995
it's just that they're on the fence

505
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:38,035
do not we know how to express

506
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:40,795
themself and not to say hey i

507
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:44,125
somehow saw racing that's why busting is

508
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,665
in fact one very good wish to

509
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:52,735
sell consulting services and the disadvantage of

510
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,335
web hosting is that's a skinning not

511
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,045
too moist far more complex

512
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,745
then it seems and that's probably the

513
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,605
issue that most of the plans that

514
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:03,355
i'm training

515
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,775
not realize that the just saying that's

516
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:11,305
tomorrow is like google analytics and that

517
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:14,305
totally forgot that's the ne twelve system

518
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,315
and you're straight on board and us

519
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:18,715
never know about us they never held

520
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:20,725
about what is a system indestructible because

521
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:22,945
when you use a google analytics solution

522
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,715
you don't have to care about this

523
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:27,145
stuff was i don't know that they

524
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:27,865
need to profit

525
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,635
fight them they don't know how complex

526
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:33,355
it can be to austin manage a

527
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:36,145
database which is growing deaf don't it

528
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,355
so this is relish the thing that

529
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:42,144
you need to take into consideration if

530
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:44,125
you provide web hosting is that if

531
00:21:44,155 --> 00:21:45,655
your client does a lot of visit

532
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:48,115
is a lot of trouble not that

533
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:51,595
well despite his his way to bring

534
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,095
a lot of opportunity to settlers of

535
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:56,335
services is really now somewhat easier to

536
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:58,825
do than the met with chin as

537
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:01,405
developed a plugin specifically for wordpress which

538
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,265
means that in one click you can

539
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,815
already deploy wordpress without taking care of

540
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,275
the metal that amazing stuff

541
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:10,165
a nation which make it of course

542
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,425
very easy to do to one dollar

543
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:15,295
maximal project

544
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,625
and whereabouts thing is of course not

545
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,115
something that's one man business can easily

546
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,845
sell because you need different expect price

547
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:26,095
and that's most obvious flaw for agencies

548
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,065
and as i just said you need

549
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:31,285
to have the system administrator on board

550
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:33,415
all the time because if you have

551
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:36,595
complex installations to send installation with

552
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:37,765
she has a lot of traffic you

553
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,350
need to have someone body know that

554
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:39,865
i'm sure

555
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:44,155
the second service which is a consulting

556
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,075
up the pros of the flying one

557
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,385
is that it can bring you constant

558
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:50,635
traffic news if you can take care

559
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:52,675
of your clients that's the three part

560
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,885
which is important in considering it's not

561
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:58,833
really about just delivering the singer it's

562
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,555
also about ensuring that the fee

563
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:03,595
x the the superbug that you provided

564
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:06,385
help your clients to go fidel and

565
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,985
go to another issue of course and

566
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:12,565
you sure which will come by him

567
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:15,325
but it's really important here to keep

568
00:23:15,355 --> 00:23:17,335
going on into contact with you with

569
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:19,195
your client if you want to have

570
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:21,235
this constant revenue sing okay

571
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:24,505
it cannot walk if your clients cannot

572
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,485
find a solution based on the date

573
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:29,155
of vegetable because you will see that

574
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:31,525
most of the time wednesday's assignments it

575
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,895
probably means that don't know it but

576
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:35,597
your client as an issue we've met

577
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:39,319
more probably a separate issue i'll probably

578
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,705
the end so that you give them

579
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:41,815
an

580
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:44,239
let's say i make some

581
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:49,495
he lost hope knew you and the

582
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,505
unnecessary silences on the good at all

583
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,815
okay so issue want to keep sending

584
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,275
consulting you have to ensure that your

585
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,375
clowns gun and self thanks to the

586
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,225
solution that you provided them is showing

587
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:03,775
good satisfaction and this is clearly what

588
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,875
is happening for maker

589
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,965
companies and as well my my toughness

590
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:11,425
is that you can solve the big

591
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:13,945
contracts what we could a big contracts

592
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:17,335
is like big clients and those clients

593
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:19,135
have a lot of needs dealing with

594
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,505
measurement plan and as a measurement kind

595
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:23,515
of very complex as it implies a

596
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:25,825
lot of different meetings

597
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:30,085
and let's say high expectations in terms

598
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,815
of project management this is where big

599
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,375
contracts are coming and this is where

600
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,735
you can start to save your company

601
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:39,715
this way you can save your yo

602
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:40,945
this is where you get the most

603
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:45,535
interesting project because it's highly motivating and

604
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:45,985
you can

605
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:49,045
really see that you have enough to

606
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:51,835
eat for the next two years and

607
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,985
those are what need to the biggest

608
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:57,325
the the bit for me the greatest

609
00:24:57,355 --> 00:25:00,385
thing you'll do to stop to build

610
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,668
a business based on that to me

611
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,255
is rare to find disconcerting a project

612
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,346
which all very close to what we

613
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:08,605
sending in ninety kicks in general so

614
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:13,225
let's say measurement plan meetings helping the

615
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,315
company grow and learn in terms of

616
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,595
knowledge and also read the most important

617
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,865
thing and the disadvantage is that they

618
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,935
can be super complex so he'll this

619
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:25,165
is where you need to be very

620
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:26,515
careful because of

621
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:29,755
vegetables can be embedded into very complex

622
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:33,565
information system on which the expertize is

623
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,325
where you were young i was thinking

624
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:39,505
for example about the companies of institution

625
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:41,357
who are deploying for example

626
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:45,895
i met him on the microsoft checkpoint

627
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:47,595
and here in order to find out

628
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:49,945
the people well the expertise about microsoft

629
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:52,765
checkpoint while i was not that many

630
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:55,285
people are appropriate those people were very

631
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:57,865
buzzy so it's it's pretty it's pretty

632
00:25:57,865 --> 00:26:00,025
hard because i'm not that much documentation

633
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,405
you need to test a lot then

634
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:02,635
through some places

635
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:04,915
she cannot embed the tracking code and

636
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:06,445
so on and so forth and of

637
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,875
course if your client is appointed it's

638
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:13,045
it's it's complicated project you'll get some

639
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:14,635
great have and so on and so

640
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:17,035
forth so this is where you need

641
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:19,675
to leave why didn't you fight before

642
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:22,285
starting the projects whole complex is going

643
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:22,525
to be

644
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:25,135
toy will have great concerns that they

645
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:25,915
will end with them

646
00:26:26,995 --> 00:26:27,895
a client of mine

647
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:31,765
kitchen you buy on the on the

648
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:34,525
project that they didn't enough the sawai

649
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:38,365
fleece i recommend you to assist with

650
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:39,925
this conference in which i would explain

651
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:42,654
underway we decided to walk but just

652
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:45,415
which tunnel were studied your project before

653
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,295
a single yes of course this is

654
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:49,705
the walk of meetings that your new

655
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,115
prayer and

656
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:54,205
prior to starting the project in order

657
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,495
to see if you feel confident to

658
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:58,555
do it and yes sometime it's up

659
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:00,085
to get your money back it goes

660
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,565
back to the super complex project that

661
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:06,385
you can get off the wrong sub

662
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:09,205
contractor that you hire people who will

663
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:11,155
not make a measurement plan which is

664
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,355
really reliable

665
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:14,995
or as on some it happens a

666
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:18,265
lot longer your projects that's the people

667
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:20,245
that you get in contact with are

668
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:23,125
finally laid off or at least while

669
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:26,455
some are and some issues and then

670
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:30,085
your project starts too it's a tool

671
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:32,215
to texas to be late and this

672
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:32,513
is where you

673
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:35,442
get your money back early to declare

674
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:37,675
this where you wouldn't need to rely

675
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,285
on modem doesn't want clients in consulting

676
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,265
if you want to make a priority

677
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:45,918
training training is definitely the thing that

678
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:47,545
i love to do the most and

679
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:49,165
that i'm doing guess what the most

680
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:51,415
what are we like training is that

681
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:53,005
can bring you high revenue in the

682
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,852
short period of time there is a

683
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,195
lot of demand far more than what

684
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:00,235
we can expect because they of course

685
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:02,845
the people while searching for its days

686
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:03,475
as one piece

687
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,635
people who like twelve one that was

688
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:07,855
not yet express that they would like

689
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,375
to have one so it's one about

690
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:13,105
knowing who's using multiple and ones you

691
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:15,145
know it's it's really easy when you

692
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:17,275
get to niche market for the for

693
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:20,095
the educational market let's do the universities

694
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:22,525
when you know that there is this

695
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:23,607
one demand from one

696
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,899
guy on the day was that even

697
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:28,705
vestiges of all using metaphor it's kind

698
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:30,175
of easy to look at deals will

699
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,875
do and say hey lady where are

700
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,645
you interesting that training about maximum

701
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:37,855
and when you when they do the

702
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:39,655
training as an if i'm not well

703
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:42,805
setting up myself here kelly

704
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:45,355
and i'm getting a lot of consulting

705
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:47,635
demands i think he it swearing during

706
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:49,645
the kissing here is that when you

707
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,925
do the training just don't be the

708
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:54,685
guy was hitting on down to just

709
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:56,215
that he felt something and then run

710
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:59,035
away it's always good to to show

711
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:00,655
off corso with the

712
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:04,135
let's say hiding the name of the

713
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,205
game was a client but to show

714
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:09,055
who you are walking and and the

715
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:10,735
way you walk as a consultant is

716
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,775
very interesting because then you offering them

717
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,925
that or you have an organization and

718
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:18,535
what kind of services that you are

719
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:20,875
providing off your path and also providing

720
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:21,625
and then the philip

721
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,175
i'm very confident you can do as

722
00:29:24,175 --> 00:29:26,575
well cross setting this is definitely what

723
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:29,365
i'm doing here with some of the

724
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:30,805
people who are about to move him

725
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,085
to death such as upon digital and

726
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:35,995
digital east eighty ivan met with jimmy

727
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:41,125
surface recommending premium features all and talking

728
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,115
about once pissed

729
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:44,125
cloud infrastructure and so on and so

730
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,215
forth that that's pretty something that you

731
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:49,225
can do and that in fact to

732
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,145
the attendees of their training out looking

733
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:52,915
for work so i'm not just interesting

734
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:54,985
enough training them so so interesting and

735
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:57,265
the possibilities that one can have with

736
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,655
the product and services and the coolness

737
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:02,275
of the training out is just

738
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:04,285
one shot revenue okay so most of

739
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:07,885
the time it's the case that the

740
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:09,715
company would take a training from you

741
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:12,145
unless it's a very big company will

742
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,875
take another one it's happened in some

743
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,857
case when the company is growing and

744
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,105
they get like new employees and the

745
00:30:19,105 --> 00:30:20,875
one just no place to get trained

746
00:30:20,975 --> 00:30:22,105
and know that you have done a

747
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:22,435
good job

748
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:24,801
time but most of the times the

749
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,685
elderly have come back for training

750
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:31,155
and thus this here the second comes

751
00:30:31,189 --> 00:30:33,165
that they put here is more full

752
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,235
of our agencies most of the time

753
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,485
and agency will spend a lot of

754
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:40,335
time in training one specific complete nissan

755
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:43,155
for your bit special because he succeeded

756
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:44,685
or she succeeded in training and get

757
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,665
certified self and decided not to go

758
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:47,265
on it's own

759
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,045
and well then it's pretty hard to

760
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:53,085
find a resulted back someone who is

761
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,605
motivated so i think he'll issue all

762
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:58,845
emergency it's always good to secure this

763
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:01,245
resource by making a mistake or do

764
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:04,575
something i do because dismissals within your

765
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:07,725
company's way of hiring and just retinal

766
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:08,145
that

767
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,675
it takes a lot of time to

768
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:10,515
train a trainer

769
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:12,585
we've got an eight x five is

770
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:14,745
important in six months you can succeed

771
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:16,695
in in think a big enough trainer

772
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:18,945
in met tomorrow isn't enough to tell

773
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:21,765
a decade i seem to know everything

774
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:23,745
about metal so let's just to let

775
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:25,485
you know that it takes a lot

776
00:31:25,485 --> 00:31:27,315
of time because it's sort of concept

777
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:29,342
it's not really about the solution in

778
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:31,725
itself which is complicated it's about time

779
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:33,735
just wondering what is the free software

780
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:36,615
philosophy what it implies and to not

781
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:38,835
be scared of the tricky part about

782
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:42,435
cellphone deploying something on the salvo ssh

783
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:44,650
all that kind of thing that's the

784
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:45,705
kind of thing you need to have

785
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,625
an interest in in order to understand

786
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:49,935
how the solution is walking because probably

787
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:51,915
that china will be as web domain

788
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,985
the man for audio different projects so

789
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:55,755
the guy talking with the devil lapels

790
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:57,972
with the unnoticed we have to sub

791
00:31:57,972 --> 00:32:00,915
spell son with the system administrator with

792
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:03,585
the client and and that's where it's

793
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:05,085
takes a lot of time in order

794
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:08,325
to understand what the orgy expectation from

795
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:08,805
one enters

796
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:12,345
the force of is that i'm sinking

797
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:15,315
off his translation and i haven't yet

798
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:18,555
received any demand for money she ok

799
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:20,745
for that but i can clearly see

800
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:22,995
that the awesome demand because met always

801
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:25,635
evolving a lot with nuclear again and

802
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:28,335
those against it doesn't get translated sometimes

803
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:30,075
or at least not in some

804
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:33,105
specific languages which means that when you

805
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:36,465
are like a dick companies let's say

806
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:38,865
for example a company based in japan

807
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,894
and taiwan all even in in i

808
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:44,535
dunno in venezuela are in no way

809
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,015
just imagined that those guy when things

810
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:50,025
started to sprinkle the future again guts

811
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,605
you why if not tomorrow which is

812
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,665
a no region and then english or

813
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:59,865
japanese and then english so it's it's

814
00:32:59,865 --> 00:33:03,285
like the two sided belsen and the

815
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,066
two sided coin in one and it

816
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:08,295
doesn't make sense so this is where

817
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:09,915
as i look at the soft grounds

818
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:10,395
it's ok

819
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:13,065
you recommended me to install the software

820
00:33:13,095 --> 00:33:15,495
and it's not even fully translated so

821
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,730
you are just giving me like alpha

822
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,445
for software could you fix that and

823
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:23,595
this is where you can definitely find

824
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:27,585
people to to translated the translation service

825
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:30,105
which has been recently put on the

826
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:30,555
net too

827
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:32,775
always a very instinctive and hope you

828
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:35,445
in translating it straight away you saw

829
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:38,655
some plugins which are specific which allow

830
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:41,235
you to make some extra translation

831
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,470
so he i think that there is

832
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,355
a lot of business opportunities to sell

833
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,515
translation services for matt to move for

834
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:51,885
a year and customize just that i

835
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:54,195
never succeeded in sending one yet

836
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:58,035
custom development is one of the sexiest

837
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:01,346
selfies to to solve the problem he

838
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:05,087
is that's and it's very very very

839
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,665
long so the pros of it is

840
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:10,034
that's very exciting it's in the project

841
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:10,695
you can ready

842
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:14,355
and i will matter more the dickens

843
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,360
is that's why quick rails that are

844
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:19,155
lots of fixed bow ties and the

845
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:23,175
nlg in order to kickstart the project

846
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:25,695
here i'm not talking about woman business

847
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:29,565
an agency who traits do custom plugin

848
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:31,995
you deserve but small like nudge

849
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:33,764
since you're a one man business who

850
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:36,554
is chasing finding out the profile who

851
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:37,935
is about to cry the met to

852
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,165
move plugin

853
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,554
those developers exist that you can easily

854
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:44,594
find them under on the community i'm

855
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:46,695
thinking health peter i'm thinking off stiff

856
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:49,725
and i'm thinking of maybe lucas i

857
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:52,099
mean there's some people within the community

858
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,795
you can develop those plugin for you

859
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,074
is just that you would be like

860
00:34:57,074 --> 00:35:00,225
demeter man in charge of listening to

861
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:00,555
your clay

862
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:04,545
lance writing the spec document and then

863
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:08,175
only get to the web developer and

864
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:11,085
what i found out within those custom

865
00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:14,475
development project issues is that in my

866
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:17,565
case i'm walking lot with french institution

867
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:19,635
is a twenty walk with a french

868
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:20,715
institution is not

869
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:24,585
that easy to hire results from the

870
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,715
outside sorta sit outside of your own

871
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:29,445
countries of france which of course make

872
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:33,975
the process even more complicated and and

873
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:35,325
this is a yeah so you need

874
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:37,755
to find the right profile to ensure

875
00:35:37,815 --> 00:35:40,875
that according to the law according to

876
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,365
the constraints without given to you by

877
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:44,745
your clients who can find a work

878
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,755
profile then you need to not screw

879
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:49,575
up when you write out the specs

880
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:52,245
document then you need to ensure that's

881
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:54,705
the spec of the client correspond to

882
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:57,345
what the developer is able to provide

883
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,805
because of the cough matt lawrence so

884
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:01,035
it's where

885
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,855
exciting project but it's pretty hard to

886
00:36:03,855 --> 00:36:07,065
stop two tickets to get paid and

887
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,885
the something which could bite the developer

888
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:12,855
will be issued in three weeks will

889
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:16,095
probably take one year two years you

890
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:17,745
know that the you know they'll to

891
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,335
be dirty but also just to let

892
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:21,195
you know that custom devil

893
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:24,075
months he says one complex project

894
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:28,095
and last but not least a service

895
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:30,195
that i'm thinking of which is to

896
00:36:30,195 --> 00:36:31,815
me as was very exciting which is

897
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:36,375
writing documentation and it happens quite a

898
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:40,185
lot i mostly by institution who do

899
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:42,885
not want to rely on the documentation

900
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:45,195
of madmen dot org which by the

901
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:45,435
way is

902
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:47,595
what well done but i want some

903
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:50,085
sandwiches more specific with swells with shell

904
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,545
different with spin shots which are using

905
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,315
that one day though we have probably

906
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,455
another language

907
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:58,575
that that'd be great this is how

908
00:36:58,575 --> 00:37:00,945
you can develop your skills didn't river

909
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:03,830
with marketing materials as a sends us

910
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,955
a lot of demand it's just that

911
00:37:05,985 --> 00:37:07,725
those demands are mostly coming from big

912
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,374
clients okay not not not small one

913
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:13,005
which of course make it more like

914
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,855
a like a niche project and the

915
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:16,635
only issue

916
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,255
that i can see here but which

917
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:20,476
is of course subject to discussion isn't

918
00:37:20,476 --> 00:37:22,665
doesn't the licenses on which all writing

919
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:25,035
does the condition can be restrictive so

920
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:27,073
that's maybe you're not going to be

921
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:29,773
able to use those documentation that you

922
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:34,575
rightful and it said public project which

923
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:35,565
of course is a

924
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:39,585
it's a bit heartbreaking but that's i

925
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,385
mean that's that's part of the game

926
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,455
right you get money for and this

927
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:45,879
money that you get for you are

928
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:48,195
under restrictions most of the times though

929
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:53,655
cross license i guess makes stays that

930
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,785
i'm seeing on the field anyways businesses

931
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:59,295
is that you can't know everything as

932
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:00,913
a woman business you would have two

933
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:03,615
roundabouts of contracting ready at the beginning

934
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,715
i thought that i could be able

935
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:07,665
to endure all the power of maximal

936
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:09,135
i would just find out the

937
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:12,945
it's just too big that they cannot

938
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,345
be good in everything so you need

939
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,955
to have a network it's not like

940
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,665
tomorrow you can decide to create your

941
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:22,275
own business based on medical unit twelve

942
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:23,472
and a talk you need to have

943
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:25,905
guys who are good and board and

944
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:27,855
definitely those guy you can find him

945
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:29,595
and shut up multiple that one

946
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:32,327
because people are attending today or are

947
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:34,002
you really from yeah we've met one

948
00:38:34,002 --> 00:38:37,815
antics and probably are familiar with it

949
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,865
you can find them as well i'm

950
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:41,865
from the metamorph dot org but it's

951
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:44,115
all about network i i cannot deliver

952
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:45,735
all the products and services that i'm

953
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:47,475
saying today if i don't have my

954
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:47,925
network

955
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,765
not always not on native that's biggest

956
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:53,325
mistake that most of the agencies i'm

957
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:55,185
doing suggesting that it's a crillon of

958
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:57,945
google analytics is the mission of net

959
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:00,675
html twelve like google antics as a

960
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:02,475
as a free software from that html

961
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,723
that's not at all something met to

962
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:07,065
me is a free software with this

963
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,060
it embrace the free of

964
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,285
philosophy which means that it's even if

965
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:14,595
people would correct me about it it's

966
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:16,215
a tricky solution and if it's a

967
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:18,405
turnkey solution you need to be at

968
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:20,835
least sticky order to understand the heart

969
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:22,815
of its heights walking and of course

970
00:39:22,815 --> 00:39:23,955
how to set it off too

971
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,685
you have to understand the free software

972
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:29,265
philosophy and it's a huge piece

973
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:32,295
it's a long term return on investment

974
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:33,615
as i say it took me five

975
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:35,865
years in order to be able to

976
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:37,635
make a living out of it but

977
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:38,775
it's three was it

978
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:41,745
you cannot succeed if you don't love

979
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:43,815
the software that that's the sing don't

980
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,905
blame the software blame yourself if they

981
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:48,735
have some sandwiches not walking cause if

982
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,415
there's something that she's not walking probably

983
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:52,455
means that say something that you are

984
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:55,065

time but it's making you visible which

998
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:25,455
is the most important thing that people

999
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:28,035
can put a face on on your

1000
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:30,885

close to three hundred websites talking about

1005
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,040
what i'm doing which helped alot give

1006
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,070
tours and conferences share with the community

1007
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,310
a network and then create your own

1008
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,860
network that's one of the reason why

1009
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,320
i was interesting in setting up these

1010
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,910
met him at cam that was about

1011
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,410
opening old

1012
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,841
the possibilities of connecting with other people

1013
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:01,670
or finding people that they can make

1014
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,420
and that they can be subcontractors of

1015
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,730
my project so you have too many

1016
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,890
