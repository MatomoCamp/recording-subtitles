00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,120
Hi, everyone. Sorry for this small delay. So it's currently 14.04. The idea is to go

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:24,640
up to probably 14.50, something like this. Feel free to ask as many questions as you

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,000
can on chat.matamoochem.org. This presentation is a bit special because it's not oriented

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,280
towards, let's say, technical things about Matamoo, neither about the software. That's,

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,240
I guess, probably the only conference talk, which is about business. So you may say, oh,

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,880
okay, that's kind of a dirty subject and so on and so forth. But I really think that's,

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,360
let's say, one of the key issues which are dealing with Matamoo, which is about how to make

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,240
a community growing. And one key thing about making a community growing is, of course,

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,800
to get attention from the outside. And one, let's say, one big thing which is out of getting

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,160
attention is how you can make a living out of Matamoo and how some individuals can

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:28,000
make it more like a business job opportunity and then have good reasons to work on a day-to-day

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,160
basis on Matamoo. So let's say how they can move from their current job that they maybe

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,040
not love into a job that they love, dealing with free software, which was my case. Of

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,080
course, when I started as an analyst, I was mostly working with proprietary solutions,

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,680
such, of course, as the one of Google. But thanks to the business opportunities I got,

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,640
I got the possibility to switch from Google Analytics Solutions and others to a full

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,600
activity around Matamoo. And that's really what this conference is about. It's about

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,480
my feedback, about how I succeeded in developing business opportunities based on Matamoo,

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,440
and as well what I observed on the field about what other companies are doing, what it works,

20
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,720
and what doesn't. And that, of course, you as an individual or your company can take an advantage

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,400
from and maybe, thanks to this feedback, help to develop more products and services based on

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:41,280
Matamoo and have as well afterwards contribution to the Matamoo community. So about myself, my

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:50,240
name is Ronan Chardonneau. I'm a digital marketing trainer at Matamoo Analytics since 2010. Back at

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:58,880
the time, more than a decade ago, Matamoo wasn't the software that it is today. So I have to say

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,360
that I've been probably one of the pioneer who bets on Matamoo. It's a few weeks at that time,

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,040
in order to start develop a business on it. I made the choice of not developing an agency,

27
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,680
of still staying a one-man business in order to not, let's say, be trapped into a system,

28
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,680
into an environment in which I won't have any control over my company anymore. I had the chance

29
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,840
to write five books about digital analytics. To be honest, I wrote three about Google Analytics,

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,840
one about Google Tag Manager, and one about Pewik. Pewik being one of the first that I published.

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:44,080
It unfortunately did not get the attention that I expected back then. And now, I mean, the attention

32
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,240
that it was in 2011 when I wrote it wasn't the same as today. I guess that today, probably, if I

33
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,840
have to write it, it will be, of course, far more consequent and will probably get far more

34
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,080
attention than it got back then. I'm associate professor in digital marketing at ERE Angers,

35
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,760
which is a university in France. I'm professor since more than a decade ago. I'm one of the few

36
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,960
Matamoo analytics certified professional when this certification was still on. You can still

37
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,160
find this certification on the project that I'm holding on a URL named FlossMarketingSchool.com,

38
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,120
on which I got the agreement from the Matamoo team to get the list of questions and revamp the

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,800
certification program in order to make it more like a free and accessible program to everyone.

40
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,240
So you can easily go on FlossMarketingSchool.com and look at the certification program and

41
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,240
answer to the different questions and get a certificate which is issued by the FlossMarketingSchool.com,

42
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,240
which has not much value, but which is here in order to test your knowledge about Matamoo analytics.

43
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,200
And yeah, I already mentioned it in the previous conference. I worked for Matamoo,

44
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,680
let's say the InnoCraft company, from July 2017 to July 2019. The purpose of this

45
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,960
talk, the following one, is to really give you some feedback about how to make a living

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,720
from Matamoo analytics. So make a living, I mean, it's like how you can make your first euros out of

47
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,160
it, but as well how you can fully live on Matamoo. It took me a lot of time in order to make it.

48
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,800
It took me about five years in order to make it, but I succeeded. And of course, it wasn't like

49
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,920
five years in which I wasn't working at all. I had my first and second employer who were, of course,

50
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:56,000
making me my main living and on my spare time, I was doing from here and then some extra services

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,960
on Matamoo, which give me some, let's say, trust in, okay, definitely there are some space in order

52
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,720
to build something up, but just to let you know that I didn't jump out into the late,

53
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,080
straight away took me up to five years in order to feel confident enough that there was enough

54
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,040
markets in order to provide Matamoo analytics products and services. But remember that it was

55
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,200
back then in 2010, so the market wasn't the one which is nowadays, which is, of course, far more

56
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:36,080
flourishing. This talk is mainly for one-man business that I call freelancers here and agencies.

57
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:44,720
And this is a business oriented talk, so I'm not going to talk about techy stuff or anything like

58
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,080
this. It's really more about business. My business history is the following one. Here, of course,

59
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:01,040
business history means Matamoo analytics history. So, in 2010, I got my first client sign for

60
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,560
training thanks to a landing page. So, in fact, my history with P-Week back then at that time

61
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,000
really started because I was a SEO practitioner, so search engine optimizer, and I was working for

62
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,120
a web agency which was providing free software website creation services. So, to say a web agency

63
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,920
which was providing the creation of website with jumla technologies, WordPress technologies.

64
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,120
At that time, it was named Magento as well, PrestaShop, all that kind of free software

65
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:48,080
technologies. And as a, let's say, web marketing specialist, I just was a bit curious that, okay,

66
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:57,840
we are all the time creating all those websites, including Google Analytics within those. And I was

67
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,160
wondering, okay, is there another technology on earth which may be a free software, not

68
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,520
proprietary software that we can embed on the website that we deliver in order to be more,

69
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,160
let's say, privacy compliant or in order to align with the mission of what free software is about.

70
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,880
This is where I discovered that there was a technology which was named P-Week. I had at

71
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,680
that time people within the web agency which were passionate enough in order to deploy

72
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,680
a P-Week instance, so to say, a server running P-Week on it. And then because we had this server

73
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,400
and because we were starting to deliver some website with P-Week included within it,

74
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,960
that I got the idea because I was also in charge of publishing content on the

75
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,480
web agency's website. Okay, why not just creating a landing page in which I will announce that we

76
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,880
are delivering a training about P-Week Analytics that at that time I didn't even know about.

77
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,760
So we just start with a bet that we just sent in the lake in order to say something which

78
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,480
wasn't true, I have to say now, that, hey, we are an agency and we deliver trainings about

79
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,000
Matomo Analytics. And I did that with several technologies. I did it with AWStats. I did it

80
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,360
with Open Web Analytics, which for some time has been a competitor of Matomo Analytics. And one

81
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,240
day the phone rang and it was one of the biggest companies in France who was on the phone. We were

82
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:41,600
really a small agency. We were dealing with really small clients in my hometown. And this

83
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,160
French multinational company just called us and said, okay, we saw on your page that you are

84
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,080
delivering P-Week Analytics training. We want you on board. We want you to come in Paris La

85
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Défense, which is the biggest business center in France. You go in this tower on the fifth floor,

86
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,440
on the 50th floor, and you go and make the training. Wow. I don't know for you guys,

87
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,440
for the people who know what Matomo looks like more than 10 years ago, but it was not like the

88
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,800
fanciest product to show on Earth. And they had to deliver a training about it. And the thing is

89
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,480
that during the training what was even funnier is that we didn't even have an internet connection.

90
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,680
And the training that I did was probably one of the worst that I ever delivered. But the thing is

91
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:42,560
that I stressed so much about it that I over trained myself on the P-Week Analytics documentation,

92
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,320
that I got enough in order to write a full book about it. And then I went to a publishing house

93
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,080
edition that I already worked with, and I said, okay, look, I have all this content material. I

94
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,720
can make a book out of it. And this is how the story starts. So, I just start with a bit, with a

95
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,640
big client, big pressure, big contract, and then enough, let's say, money in order to take a risk,

96
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:21,520
which is about publishing the content that I wrote, that I made over my weekend's periods.

97
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:28,960
So, this is how it works. Then I got this book, which, of course, in the mind of people makes you

98
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,120
like a superstar, whereas I have to say that I didn't get many sales, probably around a thousand

99
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:43,280
of books have been sold dealing with P-Week Analytics. And then what I did from 2012 to

100
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:50,240
2014, you know, I was still working with proprietary solution, and I was still frustrated

101
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,120
that P-Week was not, let's say, getting that much attention. So, I decided to create two websites

102
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,000
in order to attract some leads. It started to work. I gave some conferences here and there.

103
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It helped me make me more confident about talking about the software. I started to link a bit more

104
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,880
with the community. I've been involved into a measure camp. I don't know if you know measure

105
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,720
camp. It's kind of the biggest analytics community that you can find on Earth. I started to spread

106
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:30,080
the word about that measure camp. And I started to have more leads dealing with the time it was

107
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,960
in P-Week. And it was really making me confident. And it was really the kind of leads that I wanted,

108
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:44,880
like they were overseas. The projects were very empowering. And every lead that I got made me

109
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,280
even more comfortable and really made me realize that proprietary solutions are just not

110
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,600
showing you the full story and not helping you to educate yourself better. And that free software

111
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,240
is like offering you far more possibilities in terms of learning and education, which makes them

112
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,760
really great opportunities. And in 2015, I felt enough confident in order to say, okay,

113
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:20,000
what do I want to do in my life? And this is where I really saw that the mission of a free

114
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
software and mathematics in particular really align with what I want to do for my future.

115
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,360
And this is where I said, okay, I'm going to invest some money in order to join an accelerator.

116
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,600
We call it also an incubator in order to have some mentors, people who can tell me if my project,

117
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,280
so to say, to create a full company based on mathematics services is reliable or not.

118
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,880
And it just took me, in fact, three months. So I hired two interns in order to build up

119
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,280
a new website, in order to test some stuff around tools around Matomo and so on and so forth.

120
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,960
And in three months, that was it. In three months, I got enough contracts in order to

121
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,840
make one year living. When I say one year living, I'm not talking about millions of euros here.

122
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm talking about the time in 2015. I'm talking about a limit of 30,000 to 35,000 euros of turnover

123
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:31,040
for a one-man business. So I'm not talking here about a high-paid person. I'm really talking about

124
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,520
what is making enough for one person to live only on Matomo analytics services.

125
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,600
And I reached, in three months, I got the contract for 12 months

126
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,760
lengths of 30,000 to 35,000 euros of turnover. I have to say today, I prefer to disclose the

127
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,800
information right now that I'm making still as a one-man business 70,000 euros a year.

128
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,240
I don't want to make more because if I go more, I definitely go for a limited company,

129
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,080
which is not the thing that I want. But I can tell you that right now on the market,

130
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,760
if you are good enough, if you know how to be a good salesperson, if you are ready to go

131
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:18,800
international, that's the key thing. Most of my turnover, 60%, closely to 60% of my turnover

132
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,880
is not on the national market, which is France. It's on the international market.

133
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,680
From 2017 to 2019, I joined the InnoCraft team. So let's say it's the first

134
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,200
maintainer, the first contributor to the Matomo analytics project. That has been probably one of

135
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,200
the greatest experience that I got in my career. I got many, but this one really helped me a lot.

136
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,160
This morning we got Richard Stark, who gave a conference to which I asked what it is to

137
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,920
work at InnoCraft and really what he said aligned with what I said. I haven't been fired by the

138
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:06,640
company because you can see here that I left the company in 2019. It's just that InnoCraft is based

139
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,520
in New Zealand, so it's a 12-hour time zone of delay. And it was very exhausting on both sides.

140
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:23,600
I mean, like attending the conference by 9 p.m. in like once or twice a week is really

141
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,160
dramatic in terms of family life balance. And I came to a point of doing it for like two years

142
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,840
working with 12 hours time of delay. I just said, okay, I cannot continue. I'm destroying my family

143
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,040
life. It was a bit the same thing for them. So that's why I decided to say, okay, I'm probably

144
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,080
more helpful staying in Europe, helping from Europe, developing the Matomo Analytics community to

145
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,640
expand rather than being within the InnoCraft team. But I have to say that those two years have been

146
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:03,280
extraordinary in order to understand what is the responsibility of holding a software such as

147
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Matomo is. And from 2019 to now, this is what I said here, I succeed to double my revenues, so to say

148
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,320
70,000 euros. And I'm now, in fact, helping partners around the world to as well make a

149
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,720
living out of Matomo. This is the list of the different services that I identified by which

150
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,680
you can make a living out of Matomo. I'm not providing all of them, but I have some partners

151
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,560
who are delivering them. So I can, of course, say a couple of words about it. So first one is about

152
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:45,840
web hosting, which is mostly what big agencies are providing. Then you get the consulting part,

153
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:53,840
which is probably well as a lot to do, which is about solving complex issues. By solving complex

154
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,840
issues, I mean measurement plan, support any issues, analytics things like creating reports

155
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,400
and that kind of thing. Training. So training is really the thing that I'm known for, that I like

156
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,960
the most to do. But this is a small personal thing, which is about sharing knowledge about

157
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,960
how to use Matomo. Then the first one that I identify is translation. It hardly ever happened

158
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,960
to me, but that's possible to do. It's about translating Matomo. And trust me, there are a

159
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,480
lot to do because it's a software which is evolving a lot and which is supporting almost

160
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,720
all the languages on Earth. Custom development, which is about how to create something which

161
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,400
does not exist yet within Matomo. And the sixth one, which is about writing documentation,

162
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,760
which happen far more than we can expect. So those are, let's say like six different services

163
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,200
that I identify. And the idea is to give you some feedback about those so that you can identify a

164
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,400
little bit more about what you could do if you would like to expand your set of services or if

165
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,080
you would like to sell services based on Matomo. That's web hosting. This is really what I said

166
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,760
most of agencies are doing. What is great with web hosting is that it brings constant revenue.

167
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:26,960
So that's of course the most obvious thing. It's like you deliver websites. Why not you add to it

168
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:36,080
the possibility to as well offer when you sell your website to sell a web analytics package.

169
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,480
It brings a lot of opportunity to sell other services. And I'm quite amazed to see that a lot

170
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,320
of agencies which are already delivering websites with Matomo including are only ever taking this

171
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,520
opportunity to sell more services on top of it like consulting. Because you don't really need to

172
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,040
be like, I mean, you don't need to have followed some analytics studies. I mean, I did it myself,

173
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,880
I mean, I did it myself, but most of the time when a client has an issue, they more have an issue

174
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,800
with not about understanding the data, but which is more about how the software is working, how the

175
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,440
UI is working, which means that agencies think that they cannot easily sell consulting services

176
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
because they think they don't have the expertise. Whereas definitely they could because they have a

177
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,520
lot of different clients in which they deploy Matomo. So it means that they probably already

178
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,840
have the knowledge that their own clients need, but it's just that their own clients

179
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,080
do not really know how to express themselves in order to say, hey, I need some help. So I really

180
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:52,240
think that web hosting is in fact one very good way to sell consulting services. The disadvantage

181
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:00,720
of web hosting is that scaling Matomo is far more complex than it seems. And that's probably the

182
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:08,400
issue that most of the clients that I'm training do not realize that they just think that Matomo

183
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,040
is like Google Analytics and they totally forgot that they need to have a system administrator on

184
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,880
board. And as they never know about, as they never heard about what is a system administrator, because

185
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
when you use a Google Analytics solution, you don't have to care about this part.

186
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,240
Well, they don't know that they need a profile for it and they don't know how complex it can be to

187
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:39,040
host and manage a database which is growing day after day. So this is clearly the thing that

188
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,560
you need to take into consideration if you provide web hosting is that if your client

189
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,440
has a lot of visit, it means a lot of trouble. Not as well that this part is really the bring

190
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,520
a lot of opportunity to sell other services is really now far more easier to do than the

191
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,800
Matomo team has developed a plugin specifically for WordPress, which means that in one click,

192
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,880
you can already deploy WordPress without taking care of the Matomo database installation,

193
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,200
which makes it of course very easy to handle a Matomo project.

194
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,960
Web hosting is of course not something that one man business can easily sell because you need

195
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,920
different expertise. That's more service for agencies. And as I just said, you need to have

196
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,840
a system administrator on board all the time, because if you have a complex installation,

197
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,280
so to say an installation which has a lot of traffic, you will need to have someone on board

198
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,160
in order to help you with this. The second service, which is consulting, the pros are

199
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,840
here. The pros are the following one is that it can bring you constant revenues if you can

200
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,000
take care of your clients. That's really a part which is important. In consulting, it's not really

201
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,960
about just delivering the thing. It's also about ensuring that the fix, that the support that you

202
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,640
provided help your clients to go further and go to another issue. Of course, an issue which will

203
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,280
come by him, but it's really important here to keep going on the contact with your client

204
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,920
if you want to have this constant revenue thing. It cannot work if your clients cannot find

205
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,600
the solution based on the data of Matomo, because you will see that most of the time when there is

206
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,120
a silence, it probably means that you don't know it, but your client has an issue with Matomo,

207
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:47,440
probably a server issue, or probably the answer that you give them. Let's say he lost hope in you,

208
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,720
let's say. Let's say silences are not good at all. If you want to keep selling consulting,

209
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,840
you have to ensure that your clients got the answer thanks to the solution that you provided them.

210
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:08,240
If you are a good salesperson, and this is clearly what is happening for my company and as well my

211
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,920
partners, is that you can sell big contracts. What we call by big contracts is big clients,

212
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,520
and those big clients have a lot of needs dealing with measurement plan. As measurement plans are

213
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:30,000
very complex, as it implies a lot of different meetings. Let's say high expectations in terms

214
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,760
of project management. This is where big contracts are coming, and this is where you can start to

215
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,440
save your company. This is where you can save your year. This is where you get the most interesting

216
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:49,920
project, because it's highly motivating. You can clearly see that you have enough to eat for the

217
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:59,040
next two years, and those are really the biggest, probably the greatest thing in order to start to

218
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,440
build a business based on that. It's really to find those consulting projects which are very

219
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,720
close to what we sell in analytics in general. Let's say measurement plan, meetings, helping

220
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,560
the company to grow and learn in terms of knowledge, and those are really the most important

221
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,120
thing. The disadvantage is that they can be super complex, so here this is where you need to be very

222
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,640
careful, because Matomo can be embedded into a very complex information system on which the

223
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:40,080
expertise is very rare. Here I'm thinking, for example, about companies or institutions who are

224
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,680
deploying, for example, Matomo and Microsoft SharePoint, and here in order to find out the

225
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,360
people who have the expertise about Microsoft SharePoint. Wow, there are not that many people.

226
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,880
Probably those people are as well very busy, so it's really hard because there are not that

227
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,600
much documentation. You need to test a lot, and there are some places in which you cannot embed

228
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,320
the tracking code, and so on and so forth. Of course, if your client is disappointed,

229
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,720
it's a complicated project. You get some gray hair, and so on and so forth. This is where you

230
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,400
need to really well identify before starting the project how complex it's going to be.

231
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,760
Tomorrow I will have a great conference that I will add with a client of mine,

232
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:38,880
Katie Newby, on a project that I didn't know, so I fully recommend you to assist to this conference

233
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,400
in which I will explain the way we decided to work, but just to let you know, well study your

234
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:53,280
project before saying yes. Of course, this is the work of meetings that you do prior starting the

235
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,600
project in order to see if you feel confident to do it. Sometimes it's hard to get your money back.

236
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,520
It goes back to the super complex project that you can get or the wrong subcontractor that you hire.

237
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,320
People will not make a measurement plan which is really reliable or even submit. It happens a lot

238
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:21,920
on longer projects. The people that you get in contact with are finally laid off or at least

239
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:31,680
who have some issues, and then your project starts to be late, and this is where you get

240
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,840
your money back a little bit late, so this is where you really need to rely on more than one

241
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,960
client in consulting if you want to make a proper living. Training is definitely the thing that I

242
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,320
love to do the most and that I'm doing as well the most. What I really like in training is that it

243
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,200
brings you high revenue in a short period of time. There is a lot of demand, far more than what we

244
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,840
can expect because there are of course the people who are searching for it, but there is as well the

245
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,760
people who would like to have one but who has not yet expressed that they would like to have one.

246
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,400
It's all about knowing who is using Matamor and once you know it, it's really easy when you get a niche

247
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,320
market, for example the educational market, let's say the universities, when you know that

248
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,680
there is at least one demand from one guy and that the other universities are using Matamor,

249
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:34,080
it's kind of easy to knock at the other door and say, hey, by the way, are you interested in training about Matamor?

250
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:44,800
When I do the training, even if I'm not overselling myself here, clearly I'm getting a lot of consulting demands.

251
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:52,640
I think here, the key thing here is that when you do training, just don't be the guy who is here in order to

252
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:02,080
just deliver something and then run away. It's always good to show, of course, with let's say hiding the name

253
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:09,920
of the other client, but to show how you are working and the way you work as a consultant is very interesting

254
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,600
because then you are showing them that you have an organization and what kind of services that you are providing

255
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,840
or your partners are providing and then they feel very confident. You can do as well cross-selling.

256
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,000
This is definitely what I'm doing here with some other people who are at Matamor camp today,

257
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,040
such as Enprunt Digital and Digitalist AB or even the Matamor team itself is recommending premium features

258
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:43,840
or talking about one specific cloud infrastructure and so on and so forth.

259
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,560
That's really something that you can do. In fact, the attendees of the training are looking for as well.

260
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,960
They are not just interested in your training themselves. They are interested in the possibilities

261
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,160
that one can have with the product and services. The cons of the training is just one short revenue.

262
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:09,600
Most of the time, it's hardly ever the case that the company will take a training from you

263
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,560
unless it's a very big company will take another one. It happens in some cases when the company is growing

264
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,400
and they get new employees and they want those employees to get trained and they know that you have done a good job

265
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:30,400
the first time, but most of the times they hardly ever come back for a training.

266
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:37,760
The second cons that I put here is more for agencies. Most of the time, an agency will spend a lot of time

267
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,920
in training one specific employee or this employee a bit special because he succeeded or she succeeded

268
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:52,080
in training herself or herself and decided now to go on its own. Then it's really hard to find a resource back,

269
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,520
someone who is motivated. I think here, if you are an agency, it's always good to secure this resource

270
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,880
by making him a stakeholder or something like this because this resource within your company

271
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,400
is really of high value. Just to let you know that it takes a lot of time to train a trainer.

272
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,560
Google Analytics, for example, in six months, you can succeed in having a beginner trainer.

273
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,240
In Matomo, even after a decade, I still don't know everything about Matomo. Just to let you know

274
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,120
that it takes a lot of time because it's a lot of concepts. It's not really about the solution

275
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,640
in itself, which is complicated. It's about understanding what is the free software philosophy,

276
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,480
what it implies, and to not be scared of the techy part. That's server, deploying something on a

277
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,400
server, SSH, all that kind of thing. That's the kind of thing you need to have an interest in

278
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,520
in order to understand how the solution is working because probably the trainer will be as well

279
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,280
the middleman for all your different projects. The guy talking with the developers, with the analyst,

280
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,680
with the salesperson, with the system administrator, with the client. That's where it

281
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,800
takes a lot of time in order to understand all the expectations from one another.

282
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,240
The fourth service that I'm thinking of is translation. I haven't yet received any

283
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,960
demand for money for that, but I can clearly see that there are some demands because Matomo is

284
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,560
evolving a lot with new plugins, and those plugins do not get translated sometimes,

285
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:35,120
or at least not in some specific languages, which means that when you have big companies,

286
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,080
let's say, for example, a company based in Japan, in Taiwan, or even in, I don't know,

287
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,760
in Venezuela or in Norway, just imagine that those guys, when they install those premium

288
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:55,200
features on those two plugins, they've got a UI of Matomo, which is Norwegian and then English,

289
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:05,360
or Japanese and then English. It's like a two-sided person and a two-sided coin in one,

290
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,000
and it doesn't make sense. This is where they look at the software and they say,

291
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,840
okay, you recommended me to install this software, and it's not even fully translated, so you are

292
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,560
just giving me half of the software. Could you fix that? This is where you can definitely

293
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,880
find the people to translate it. The translation service, which has been recently put

294
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,680
on Matomo, is very instinctive and helps you in translating it straight away. You also have some

295
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:44,000
plugins which are specific, which allow you to make some extra translation. Here, I think that

296
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,080
there is a lot of business opportunities to sell translation services for Matomo for your

297
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:57,120
end-customer. It's just that I never succeeded in selling one yet. Custom development is one of the

298
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:07,840
sexiest services to sell. The problem is that it's very, very, very long. The pros of it is that it's

299
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:16,160
very exciting. It's a non-project. You can really empower Matomo, but the cons is that it requires

300
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:24,640
a lot of expertise and energy in order to kickstart the project. Here, I'm not talking about

301
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:32,320
one-man business or an agency who will create the custom plugin itself, but more like an agency or

302
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,560
one-man business who is chasing, finding out the profile, who is able to create the Matomo

303
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,200
plugin. Those developers exist. You can easily find them on the community. I'm thinking here of

304
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,280
Peter. I'm thinking here of Stefan. I'm thinking here of maybe Lucas. There are some people within

305
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,160
the community who can develop those plugins for you. It's just that you will be the middleman

306
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:05,760
in charge of listening to your client, writing the spec document, and then on-link it to the

307
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,080
web developer. What I found out within those custom development project issues is that,

308
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,200
in my case, I'm working a lot with French institutions, is that when you work with a

309
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,240
French institution, it's not that easy to hire a resource from the outside. Let's say outside of

310
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,000
your own country, so France, which, of course, makes the process even more complicated.

311
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,960
You need to find the right profile to ensure that, according to the law or according to the

312
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,440
constraints which are given to you by your clients, you can find the right profile.

313
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,480
Then you need to not screw up when you write out the spec document. Then you need to ensure that

314
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,560
the spec of the client corresponds to what the developer is able to provide because of the core

315
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,160
of Matomo. It's a really exciting project, but it's really hard to start to kick it to get paid.

316
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,520
Something which could, by the developer, be issued in three weeks will probably take

317
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,800
one year or two years in order to be delivered. Just to let you know that custom

318
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:29,040
development is, as well, a complex project. Last but not least, a service that I'm thinking of,

319
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:36,880
which is, to me, as well, very exciting, which is writing documentation. It happens quite a lot,

320
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,000
mostly by institutions who do not want to rely on the documentation of Matomo.org, which,

321
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,880
by the way, is really well done, but they want something which is more specific,

322
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,240
with words which are different, with screenshots which are using their own data, with probably

323
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,120
another language. That's really great. This is how you can develop your skills dealing with

324
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,880
marketing materials. As I said, there's a lot of demand. It's just that those demands are mostly

325
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,400
coming from big clients, not small ones, which, of course, make it more like a niche project.

326
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,320
The only issue that I can see here, which is, of course, subject to discussion, is that the

327
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,680
licenses on which you are writing those documentation can be restrictive. Maybe you're

328
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:33,520
not going to be able to use those documentation that you write for, let's say, a public project,

329
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:42,160
which, of course, is a bit heartbreaking, but that's part of the game. You get money for,

330
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,280
and this money that you get for, you are under restrictions. Most of the time, it's under

331
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,880
a closed license. The biggest mistake that I'm seeing on the field dealing with businesses

332
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,800
is that you cannot know everything as a one-man business. You will have to learn about

333
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,760
subcontracting. Really, at the beginning, I thought that I could be able to handle all the

334
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,960
parts of Matomo, and I just find out that it's just too big, that I cannot be good in everything.

335
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,640
So, you need to have a network. It's not like tomorrow you can decide to create your own

336
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,280
business based on Matomo. No, you need to have a network. You need to have guys who are good on

337
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,680
board. Definitely, those guys, you can find them on chat.matomocamp.com, because people

338
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,000
who are attending today are probably already familiar with Matomo Analytics, and probably are

339
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,400
familiar with it. You can find them as well on forum.matomo.org, but it's all about network.

340
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,440
I cannot deliver all the products and services that I'm saying today if I don't have my network.

341
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,880
Matomo is not Google Analytics. That's the biggest mistake that most agencies are doing.

342
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,600
So, just think that it's a clone of Google Analytics. Even if it's the mission of Matomo

343
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:04,240
to have Google Analytics as a free software through Matomo, that's not at all the same thing.

344
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,960
Matomo is a free software. With this, it embraces the free software philosophy, which means that

345
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,360
even if people will correct me about it, it's a techie solution. If it's a techie solution,

346
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,080
you need to be at least techie in order to understand the heart of it, how it's working,

347
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,680
and, of course, how to sell it afterward. You have to understand the free software philosophy, and

348
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,920
it's a huge piece. It's a long-term return on investment. As I said, it took me five years in

349
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,120
order to be able to make a living out of it, but it's really worth it. You cannot succeed if you

350
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,880
don't love the software. That's the thing. Don't blame the software. Blame yourself if there's

351
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,040
something which is not working, because if there's something which is not working, it probably means

352
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,440
that there is something that you are missing somewhere along the education of the software.

353
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,360
How to promote your Matomo services? This is the list of things that I'm doing which are

354
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,400
working, but all together. It's not just one single thing. Writing books, tutorials, publishing

355
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,640
marketing materials, or education materials is working. I have about 500 videos running on the

356
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,760
internet, and it really helps. People are not coming straight to us thanks to those videos.

357
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,840
It happens sometimes, but it's making you visible, which is the most important thing. People can put

358
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:33,920
a face on your name, and then they can rely on you if they have any questions. Other websites or

359
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,480
several websites introducing your services. I have about close to 300 websites talking about what

360
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm doing, which helps a lot. Give talks and conferences, share with the community, have a

361
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,560
network, and then create your own network. That's as well one of the reasons why I was

362
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,800
interested in setting up this Matomo camp. That was about opening all the possibilities of connecting

363
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:07,600
with other people, finding people who can be subcontractors of my project if I have too many

364
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,560
demands, or if I cannot do something, or as well potential clients, and so on and so forth. That's

365
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,120
the way it works. Mention it to your existing clients. Do not forget to always be on social

366
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:27,280
networks. Connect with those clients of yours, and tell them about the changes which occur on

367
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,000
Matomo recently. Involve yourself within free software projects. That's as well very important

368
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,200
to understand the free software philosophy. That's it for this conference. I really hope

369
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:46,400
that you enjoy it and that you have plenty of questions. Okay, Lucas. Well, I guess

370
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,200
we don't have any questions for this talk. I hope everything was clear. Thank you,

371
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:09,680
once more, for choosing this conference, and hope you are all having a great Matomo camp. Thank you.
