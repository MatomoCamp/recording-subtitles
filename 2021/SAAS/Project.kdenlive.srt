it's docked him to turn your modem

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,230
interface into dark google tend to and

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,320
prevents incoming users to me

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,100
to move unf in from google analytics

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,410
to the metro interface and they will

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,790
love the google tim

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,750
playing to the metro interface and a

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,870
captcha widget plugin which provide you many

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,690
widgets that you can put on your

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,410
dashboard and will generate tiny widgets with

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,240
a single kp eye on it

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,620
the purpose of the stalker we are

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,530
talking about memo advance configuration and how

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,610
to collect specific data we are adding

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,320
more context to the data we are

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,750
collecting and how to create awesome reports

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,550
in your says and then we are

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,280
going further is premium plugins

38
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,880
we are not talking about infrastructure because

39
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,210
there are many peoples admitted mowjcamp already

40
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,120
added it better than i can and

41
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,920
it's not the purpose of my talk

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,389
we are assuming that you already have

43
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,650
our gdp our compliance so you already

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,898
have a deck cookie a cookie wall

45
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,790
or cookie banner because we are going

46
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,710
to use the visitor log the user

47
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,160
id and user profile and dos and

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,130
do the functionality require a user

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,070
consent and being in gdp are compliant

50
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,260
so and i imagine that you are

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,482
in a basic metal configuration so you

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,290
already have deployed the default trucking gun

53
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,330
on every single page you want to

54
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,630
track and this default bear tracking code

55
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,900
will provide you some data such as

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,310
pages and stations

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,610
unique and new visitors that some default

58
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,420
events the hardware and software configuration visitor

59
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:59,970
have to to walk through your website

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,430
under sometimes i shall have an internal

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,190
search the terms basically tracking some real

62
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,410
time action the loads enlightened as a

63
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,470
default events and the ip based location

64
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,780
so that's all the data on a

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,190
part of the data that matter more

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,480
already collect fire

67
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,570
and you need a bit more unique

68
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,230
user segmentation you need and a well

69
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,140
synced user profile to assess you we

70
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:27,300
need again to add more context to

71
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,240
the data we collect and we we

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,130
are we will be able to create

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,190
a custom events custom goals and we

74
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,720
will see in the cylinder

75
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,210
part how to create a report of

76
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,000
a javascript error that the user will

77
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,010
find on your smartphone

78
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,120
the first part of this talk is

79
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,370
about collecting or even data and in

80
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,900
a single time we will see how

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,810
to apply them in a property reports

82
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,630
are directly in in your assess battle

83
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,200
one of the first thing you have

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
to do is to switch between the

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,690
basic metal configuration to the metamorph tag

86
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,140
monitor configuration and to do this you

87
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,440
just have to switch between the tracking

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,230
code that provides by meta mode and

89
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,600
placing this meta tag manager code

90
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,910
on every single page you want to

91
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,360
track

92
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,760
don't forget to place the default meta

93
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,600
mo statistic dagger which allows you to

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,620
recreate the default madman configuration metamorphic manager

95
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,140
provides you a cool interface to create

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,290
tags are configuring some awkward stuff like

97
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,660
custom events and many many things

98
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,880
that we will see her in the

99
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,780
in this talk

100
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,970
the things that will have very very

101
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,090
help us to configure metamorph while yosef

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,480
is building up custom events during a

103
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,360
long visit the your user will perform

104
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,820
key actions on your software on your

105
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,100
website and you have to track and

106
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,960
the older johnny of your users

107
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,470
to trigger those custom events and collect

108
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,540
them into your meta mo or interface

109
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,907
at this present event will be a

110
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:16,920
send back to meta mo and i

111
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,340
collected and displayed in the events reports

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
are right in your meta mo or

113
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,440
instance

114
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,750
and to start regularly i create two

115
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,890
basics event based on the form submission

116
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,370
there is the login andor register from

117
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,140
submission on your says and we just

118
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,840
have to create this a kind of

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,170
evans

120
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,490
so look you go adjusting your back-office

121
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,910
creates a metamorph analytics a dagger you

122
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,340
switch then and the target to the

123
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,380
trucking type of evens

124
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,410
and then you have to configure your

125
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,750
evens i said the event category two

126
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,810
else to keep looking and register event

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,450
under the same name and define uneven

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,620
name as a login

129
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,500
we then have to create a trigger

130
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,152
as a form submit and we just

131
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,780
plug that trigger to the form id

132
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,300
and listen for reason or perform some

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,000
form submission sorry so we have to

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
find the form id

135
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,830
just have to inspect your website and

136
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,370
search for the id of your login

137
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,800
or register form here is a login

138
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,060
that form id and then your trigger

139
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,700
will be created and assigned to the

140
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,510
metamorph event tag don't forget to publish

141
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,350
a new

142
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,809
container on your website or it will

143
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,622
won't work and then you earn you

144
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:52,050
your dresser in these few steps have

145
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,570
the ability to collect every single time

146
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,640
a user he just looked in in

147
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,520
your suspect form and don't worry about

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,200
that you can create the same thing

149
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,600
for register events and fought

150
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,480
many many things i'm talking here about

151
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,120
some entities that you are that you

152
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,620
manage on your suspect form

153
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,280
let imagine for a crm platform that

154
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,350
you have a contact that the user

155
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,660
can create every single time they create

156
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,580
a contact on and have another kind

157
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,230
of entity they can and made the

158
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,570
staff like in development we say he

159
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,180
took credit credit for create read update

160
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,860
and delete the other four

161
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,110
main action that you can do to

162
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,570
almost any entity on your platform

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,050
and it will be interesting of collecting

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
dues action and placing them in the

165
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,680
in the visitor johnny on your website

166
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,850
and one of the four action of

167
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,730
the credit the red action is already

168
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,840
tracked by meta mo only if the

169
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,520
the entity has a one page like

170
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,530
for example if you see an air

171
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,770
bnb and when you can you created

172
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,510
a newer logement and a new house

173
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,300
three the house will be available for

174
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,560
everyone directly from google also matter mo

175
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,000
can correct them

176
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,250
as as a bureau of the this

177
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,290
entity but for the create a date

178
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,180
and delete there is no custom events

179
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,310
by default so you have to to

180
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,820
set them up just as we saw

181
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,950
with the form submission event

182
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,962
another application that i already made for

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,059
the rule platform is like when you

184
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,070
have a suspect from wiz

185
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,060
with many workspace on many teams a

186
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:47,490
user can create one or many teams

187
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,050
and then you can add a member

188
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,540
remove a member or deleted him this

189
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,030
is a factual example of how you

190
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,610
can manage your different custom events and

191
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,250
how you can name them to to

192
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,590
to to them finally visual of them

193
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,400
are right in your

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,340
or metamora instance don't forget to earn

195
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,220
package all that different event of the

196
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,180
credit under the same event category name

197
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,150
this category name it will be a

198
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,890
team event probably

199
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,530
then now you have your custom evens

200
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,020
deployed on your platform and you have

201
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,570
the ability in metal to create custom

202
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,868
goals based on those events so madam

203
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:33,150
will provide you a nigger uneasy interface

204
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,730
to configure a goal and mark all

205
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,160
the session that achieve one or

206
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,730
while many goals and to consider that

207
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,090
said that the visit has converted you

208
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,740
you are a user into a lead

209
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,730
or a customer

210
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,880
so far this or this part you

211
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,170
just have to create a new goal

212
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,360
like a leica at one of the

213
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,860
three you can see there for the

214
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,900
login as you see my goal name

215
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,880
is log-in the description is for a

216
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,160
user connect to his account and the

217
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,770
goal is triggered when an a user

218
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:07,800
send an event under the event name

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,090
is exactly a login

220
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,015
what we said we set up at

221
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:14,095
the producer site

222
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,165
another huge bot that there will be

223
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,325
a really really interesting and to add

224
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,485
context to our two met timo is

225
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:27,415
using custom dimensions because he the data

226
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:30,745
that metamora collect basically is very lacking

227
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:33,595
contexts and for some reason we are

228
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,305
using metamorph to earn two

229
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:36,685
added this context to the data

230
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,865
custom dimensions are not really hard to

231
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:45,085
set up but you have to follow

232
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,895
some rules and here in our configuration

233
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,445
we are using metamorph tag manager and

234
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:53,635
a madman tag manager we have to

235
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:57,325
set up a data layer like the

236
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:57,865
with a piece

237
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,361
of code you can see and because

238
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,705
they bet you you just see an

239
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,425
under screen discard snipe it's an easy

240
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:08,275
little layer that i filled with two

241
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,795
custom value the looked in actually set

242
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,165
to true and the usual plan actually

243
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,155
set to premium

244
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:19,375
and then in your or madman tag

245
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,105
manager you just have to go back

246
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,835
to your main meta most artistic tag

247
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,495
and changed the configuration of your matter

248
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:28,915
mo

249
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:30,595
value valuable

250
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,045
in this madam available if you scroll

251
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:37,045
down you will find this section about

252
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,195
custom dimensions m you can create you

253
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:43,375
can add an earn automatic tracking of

254
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,015
your custom dimensions here the first index

255
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,215
is for use or plan and the

256
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:50,815
signum index is for logged in honored

257
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:51,415
user

258
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:56,215
so about the two custom dimensions i

259
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,025
already tell tell you as you can

260
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,975
see when you are locked in we

261
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:04,135
just display true in the that a

262
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:06,145
year and when you are an animal

263
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,365
spirit people are not just not look

264
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,555
in we set false end of the

265
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:11,755
day or doozy

266
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,825
true kind of data will be and

267
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:15,865
will be here upload to matter more

268
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,325
every time you change the page and

269
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:21,115
we will have a full vision of

270
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:23,125
the status of the user

271
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,725
the single dimensions i already have set

272
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,675
up many times is the user plan

273
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,055
based on

274
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,405
the business offer many suspect from will

275
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:38,048
be a freemium to premium strategy and

276
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:39,925
the first time you we have many

277
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,625
individuals but people are using a free

278
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,875
plan that's what you can see in

279
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,405
the further delay you're displayed on the

280
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:49,795
slide and then the user will try

281
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:50,785
the soft

282
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:53,875
using a trial period long as one

283
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:58,473
or many weeks and then depending of

284
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:01,525
your solution and then a during his

285
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:04,375
period i send specific code as a

286
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:06,535
trial for the value of the user

287
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,475
plan viable in that a lawyer and

288
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:11,545
then when the trial period as handed

289
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,785
my user i just switched to their

290
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:17,635
premium plan and ice i just them

291
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,915
did i just send that value into

292
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:21,415
that at a year of metal

293
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,215
now we know how to create custom

294
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:29,545
events custom goals and custom dimensions but

295
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:32,185
we have to attach all of those

296
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:36,295
data to our user because we are

297
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:38,005
in a sass configuration and we have

298
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:40,075
a login and a user

299
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:44,155
our user is our main entity and

300
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,745
we have to attach of the data

301
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,085
so we are going to know how

302
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:51,475
to pass a visitor to a user

303
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:56,634
mademoiselle has a free and as a

304
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:59,545
completa functionality about user id and two

305
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:03,115
way of deploying it into yaka here

306
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,795
the first line as you can see

307
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,135
is back that besh a set user

308
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:09,355
id his father default multiple tracking code

309
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,815
or if you are using metamorph tag

310
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:12,745
manager uk

311
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:14,635
can continue to use your data layer

312
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:17,185
and just add accustomed valuable as user

313
00:14:17,185 --> 00:14:20,125
id and then as value the unique

314
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:23,395
identifier you just choose between data of

315
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,575
your database the user id will act

316
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:30,325
as a bridge between your database and

317
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,305
the meta mo database it will be

318
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:32,905
it will allow

319
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,785
oh you to track a user across

320
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:38,575
different device they use at home like

321
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,855
a smartphone or a laptop or a

322
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:43,885
business computer or you you will be

323
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:47,845
able to track them and then we

324
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:49,795
as you will see in the next

325
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:52,495
slide you are able to see every

326
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:53,025
single

327
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:55,285
visit an action an event a triggered

328
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:59,215
right on the profile generated in the

329
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,525
metamorph site so here is my own

330
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:01,945
profile

331
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:05,359
and as you can see i'm at

332
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,455
one hundred er visits in reality i'm

333
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:10,795
very very far off hundred visits vary

334
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,465
more but and the profile is limited

335
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,045
to the last hundred visits

336
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:18,955
at the display i'm sure that you

337
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:21,625
can expand this value but actually it's

338
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,665
locked to the hundred and you will

339
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:26,605
find on this profile every every action

340
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,575
and every events that the user trigger

341
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,515
on the matter my difference you will

342
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,165
see this in the in the next

343
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:37,225
slide that we won't you die

344
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:40,105
prickly these ribbed profile to the on

345
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,265
metal but we prefer asking the ici

346
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:44,425
to create a keystone profile right on

347
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:44,905
your ass

348
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,745
and then because you're a company you

349
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:52,465
have to gain some money and we

350
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:55,555
have to configure metamorph and hence ecommerce

351
00:15:55,615 --> 00:16:00,145
for isis and it's a functionality that

352
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:02,425
is a built in meta mo you

353
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:04,795
can enable it just by turning on

354
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:06,265
the switch to

355
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:09,835
e-commerce enabled and set up the currency

356
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:13,135
you use you have your own two

357
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:16,015
other fully implementation of metamora enhanced ecommerce

358
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,295
you have to configure your data layer

359
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,965
and add some code on the product

360
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,455
page or in the optional a different

361
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:23,875
pitch

362
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:28,225
the metamora e-commerce retrigger trigger some events

363
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:31,195
and those events will be

364
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:36,415
readable in the events report right in

365
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:38,425
madame of all the events you will

366
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:40,915
trigger will be under the even category

00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,555
of subscription and as you can see

368
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:45,265
on the screener that i just picked

369
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,265
on the demo the condition because of

370
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:50,545
my website is not an e-commerce website

371
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,585

00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:55,405
of my customers and so thanks to

373
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,515

00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:59,875
and as you can see owe the

375
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,035
event action are saying that cancellation and

00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:09,954
pretty cool and as usual you can

379
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:12,714
add value to events and this value

380
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:15,835
will will be used to calculate minimum

381
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,785
value of another age vary

382
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:19,255
you of your revenue

383
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,755
then meta mo we provide you for

384
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:26,185
two hundred euro per year a funeral

385
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:28,555
or e-commerce plugin that will allow you

386
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:31,675
to do two pizza kind of become

387
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:34,855
in your funnel to define where are

388
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,015
your users are leaving and the spa

389
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,305
town and the

390
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:39,985
why

391
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,895
the the user are leaving they cut

392
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:46,135
their cart so they are trigger every

393
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:49,525
year at every step accustomed events and

394
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:50,965
this event will be or will be

395
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:53,215
catch by meta mo and generate some

396
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:56,815
cool stuff uncle event base a report

397
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,935
but this is on a premium feature

398
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,745
so now we're we are able to

399
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:06,175
collect data but the most important part

400
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:08,815
is to retrieve the data and create

401
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,335
some cool reports and analyze them to

402
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,885
take a good decision in the next

403
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:14,125
time

404
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:19,435
for this first a folly second part

405
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,685
we will talk about segments because your

406
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,875
metamora instance is no filled by useful

407
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,285
data and we are not going to

408
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,535
visual them in the proper reports using

409
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,225
segments

410
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:32,665
the first category of segments that i

411
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:35,665
will create will be gold segments based

412
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:38,575
on achievements honored of a goal and

413
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,525
here as you can see we just

414
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:44,305
create cool blue segments which allow you

415
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:45,895
to filter the visits

416
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:50,455
the one using the achievements of a

417
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:52,705
goal and here i thought the goal

418
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,055
to subscribe

419
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:58,015
which is a if a user have

420
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:00,715
triggered an event subscribe which convert the

421
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:02,755
goal subscribe or if it will be

422
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,755
a feature in this segment it's critical

423
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,325
to to activate a segment and continue

424
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,635
to visualize all the reports in my

425
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:12,805
demo with a future

426
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,975
then the thing that type of a

427
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,345
segment i will allow you to create

428
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,545
is about dimensions segments earlier in the

429
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:26,965
seoul korea recreate to that custom dimensions

430
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:29,155
a one father looked in user and

431
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,285
this one one for the user plan

432
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:35,365
and we can have five types of

433
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:38,125
results of his dog only logged in

434
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,435
user from user in trial period users

435
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:45,655
and premium users all of these configuration

436
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,145
will be for me a custom segments

437
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:50,185
so here for the example i just

438
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,465
created a segment for premium users

439
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,955
so you can select in the first

440
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:58,465
dropdown the user plane and this is

441
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,245
obviously your custom dimension and then the

442
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:05,245
operator is is and the value is

443
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,295
about premium

444
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,285
so you will be able to store

445
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:13,825
as many segments as you want in

446
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:15,955
your selector and then switch between them

447
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,595
and it will be easier for you

448
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:21,355
to track and to visualize the johnny

449
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,275
of your user or right under my

450
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,205
remote interface

451
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,650
this signal bouts will be better for

452
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,430
technical or developer person and i invite

453
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,740
you to enable javascript tracking error right

454
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,370
in your meta move configuration for metamora

455
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,620
tag manager user it will be in

456
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,250
the meta mo statistics are available on

457
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:45,910
you yet just

458
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,400
have a checkbox to enable and it

459
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,620
will collect for you a javascript tracking

460
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:50,920
error

461
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,580
this report will allow you to regret

462
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,560
the decision of the user who uncontrolled

463
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,660
an error in an attempt to reproduce

464
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,640
it and it will be very very

465
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,410
important for sus owner

466
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,230
the

467
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,600
the functionality a will catch error displayed

468
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,580
in the console and trigger an event

469
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,210
ah which one are all grouped into

470
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,210
the even category of javascript error here

471
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,584
as you can see i have fought

472
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:24,790
javascript are triggered from the beginning of

473
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,470
the months or so

474
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,690
we have the five so i have

475
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,790
to fix it and as you can

476
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,220
see in then the second part in

477
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,650
even action you will have at the

478
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,650
time that you are all of the

479
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,390
html page all the javascript file which

480
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,590
contain the il

481
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,190
and then if you switch to the

482
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,990
event name you will have the message

483
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,100
right display in this table it's a

484
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,860
copy of the message which is normally

485
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,960
displayed in the console of your web

486
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,960
browser though it will help you to

487
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,210
to view a difference error

488
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,620
to exploit those information or you have

489
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,900
to create a segment this segment will

490
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,750
be uneven category based on javascript error

491
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,510
look at jack evans category is javascript

492
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,510
or this segment will be applied to

493
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,540
all of your information and then you

494
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,850
can switch to the visitor log and

495
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,510
as you can see

496
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,690
this is though force visits that have

497
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,360
encountered a javascript error since the beginning

498
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,900
of the months

499
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,910
there is an kind of problem with

500
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,700
this and because as you can see

501
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,340
every visitors that you can see on

502
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,710
the screen has just made a one

503
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,400
page you and have three actions because

504
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,920
of a javascript trucking and trigger an

505
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,110
event and an event in

506
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,950
metamora are

507
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,750
account into their actions as you can

508
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,940
see a user who just

509
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,390
work through one page has tree action

510
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,240
counted so it will break the ratio

511
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,400
of their actions per page or actions

512
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,370
per session and it will earn

513
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,420
not let you have clear information or

514
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,210
maybe it will be fun to find

515
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,700
a solution to not match those events

516
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,530
into the action counter

517
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,390
and then we enter in the in

518
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,050
my favourite section of the stoke it's

519
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,540
about the reporting a p i saw

520
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,070
a meta mo is no fool of

521
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,190
data on metal heaviness of great and

522
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,050
powerful a poi so why not using

523
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,760
it in your back office to generate

524
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,020
context all chats

525
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,260
this is a screenshot of my own

526
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,190
websites our i provide some contents mainly

527
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,660
textual content and here are some blog

528
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,510
post as you can see in my

529
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,850
homemade back office i have a chats

530
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,850
and his chart is generated directly from

531
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,300
metamorph

532
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,300
in korea met him i p i

533
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,110
provides me the data i need and

534
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,420
and those that are are organized a

535
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,060
page per page so i asked the

536
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,030
metal api i providing and the post

537
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,770
you are all and the metamora api

538
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,120
i i'll let me

539
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,800
find data that data i just configured

540
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,870
them a demo a poi to answer

541
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,330
me in a decent format and then

542
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,200
i i i took those data and

543
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,620
used them to build a homemade charts

544
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,320
using the html library charges

545
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,410
and as you can see it's pretty

546
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,450
nice and i have the information right

547
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,890
in my back office and i don't

548
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,600
have to connect to my multiple instance

549
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,440
to visual them and adjusting the rights

550
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,150
of the chats you can see my

551
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,230
visit kp i information and the bounce

552
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,700
rates of every single

553
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:06,670
episodes and as a real user i

554
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,760
prefer looking at those chats right in

555
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,250
my back office then switching to the

556
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,290
metro interface and searching in their page

557
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:14,890
reports

558
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,650
to to to get those informations

559
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,980
and then we can do exactly the

560
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,587
same thing with user a i based

561
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,960
data and so here is my own

562
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,760
profile because i don't want to show

563
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,130
you or other providers but here as

564
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,840
you can see i have is already

565
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,880
set up on my website and the

566
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,910
set the user id let me asking

567
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:38,890
the ip i have my demo

568
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,910
to get every page you earn sessions

569
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,110
and from earth specific user so he

570
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,730
here though jason the thought of his

571
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,200
rise in a custom job to grant

572
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,660
a clear position of the user visits

573
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,990
as you can see i'm pretty active

574
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,520
on my website and their first and

575
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,110
nov i have

576
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,960
had a long work to reorganize contents

577
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,880
on our site so i made almost

578
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,750
four hundred and fifty visits but i

579
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,270
can see if a user is still

580
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,640
active on its on their website

581
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,310
and an id of a cms integration

582
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,800
of that metamora a poi is because

583
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,070
of the tenements about google search engine

584
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,290
and the integrating their core web vitals

585
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,470
so here and it's an idea that

586
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,490
we can build a plugin for cms

587
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:33,910
like wow

588
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,570
press a to show up just on

589
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,850
the line of the the table that

590
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,740
display all the page all the posts

591
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,110
are published on though your website a

592
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,650
clear indicator read to a green indicator

593
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,080
to to determine if the page load

594
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,520
faster on it

595
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,307
and i am not graffiti but i

596
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,650
just make that little lower visualization based

597
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,420
on the this is a screen from

598
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,240
the the documentation of repress i just

599
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,730
add pagespeed under a greener green lights

600
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,380
but as you can see it will

601
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,930
be a bit array to have this

602
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,280
kind of informations

603
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,960
and then and to go further and

604
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,630
you can also create custom announce but

605
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,190
this you can create to someone else

606
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,160
for unmoved area every supporter not even

607
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:29,320
not only sasa suspect from but i

608
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,260
i create all the time customer asks

609
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,000
about dropped and visit to drop in

610
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,040
revenue and if you're suffer from drop

611
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,460
in subscriptions and it will be very

612
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,080
important for you to to keep an

613
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,540
eye on it and you can do

614
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,780
it simply by installing the custom adults

615
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,450
plugin who is already available on the

616
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,710
market which undone

617
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,790
marketplace of fatima

618
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,900
and then to go or to continue

619
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,060
and go further and furthermore there is

620
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,630
a premium bundle of begin which is

621
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,960
specifically into reasons for your sass and

622
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,940
as a heat map and session recording

623
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:09,400
which generates an amount and amount of

624
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,640
data but will allow you to recreate

625
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,880
the position of your user just imagined

626
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,550
that this plugin mixed with the jess

627
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:20,560
tracking error and you will be able

628
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,750
to recreate exactly the position of the

629
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,690
user to try to reproduce their own

630
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,650
the the the the gs era that

631
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,159
he uncontrolled in inherit visits and we'd

632
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,600
be pretty pretty useful for fires us

633
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,170
and especially if you have a platform

634
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,500
that shackleton's for many users as a

635
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,510
content at the door and visitors you

636
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,030
will be a friend you will be

637
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,840
a really are

638
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,180
interested in the media and eight explosion

639
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,210
which allow you to track a video

640
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,390
and the audio and give you information

641
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,850
such as the lead the lengths of

642
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,390
the video that user really watch all

643
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,000
and then the the level of the

644
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,740
volume when they're here are some audio

645
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,190
or video

646
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,200
and the next one on the day

647
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,660
i didn't found her on the base

648
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,160
is the user flu

649
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,880
plugin that allow you to track to

650
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,460
visualize not to try to visualize all

651
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,280
of your users and on the on

652
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,920
the platform and but it is very

653
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,180
more specific

654
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,111
and through a to certain kind of

655
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:29,500
sauce

656
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,340
though thank you for watching i will

657
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,220
look for the different edition you have

658
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,700
to to to to ask to me

659
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
and the and thank you for all

660
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,900
the people who are still there until

661
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,860
the this presentation

662
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,650
so as i can see i have

663
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,350
one question is can you disclose the

664
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,870
name of the suspect from you applied

665
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,430
a dos implementation

666
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,420
i actually for the demonstration you saw

667
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,130
mine and the the other one startups

668
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,500
at not in the city where i

669
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,500
live actually and and i i think

670
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,600
no i can't they those name

671
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,530
according to you and all what is

672
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,270
missing within metal

673
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,090
what is missing in matrimony

674
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,690
i don't think it's if it's missing

675
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,310
but for me it's about

676
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,530
the data storage so if your interests

677
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,100
in google and attics three and four

678
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,720
as you can see they are they

679
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,240
break the the change for thou thou

680
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,270
breaking them that at her age to

681
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,750
another one based on event and matomo

682
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,520
is a mix of

683
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:47,966
and as you can see for just

684
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:50,625
tracking all ecommerce tracking they are all

685
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,355
based on events and which is pretty

686
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:56,055
cool and i think the way of

687
00:30:56,055 --> 00:31:01,425
the future followed for analytics software but

688
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:04,635
it's a break many reports and simply

689
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:06,285
because the older either

690
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:08,175
that's all i do

691
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:11,055
mixed a mirror under on the same

692
00:31:11,055 --> 00:31:13,245
place so to get a clearer vision

693
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:16,035
we're we almost every time have to

694
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:19,755
create a customer segments and to to

695
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:22,065
see only specific events we need one

696
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:25,035
maybe the events report will could be

697
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:25,365
better

698
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:30,495
is there any other christian i

699
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:32,595
don't think

700
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:37,755
and let's wait just a few more

701
00:31:37,755 --> 00:31:40,635
seconds to make sure that nobody else

702
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,965
is making questions in the chat ok

703
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:23,625
okay i have another question why i

704
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,275
poi did you find a solution to

705
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:27,405
have less five and a tenant it

706
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:28,875
on a specific page

707
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:30,945
i

708
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:35,595
and my ip i called all based

709
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:39,135
on the timestamps at the door and

710
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:42,105
i guess it's about day not five

711
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,875
or ten minutes it's a specific and

712
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,935
i don't remember because all of my

713
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,515
the time selector or abe's on day

714
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:52,065
weeks and months acidic or not

715
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:56,505
about two minutes but maybe i am

716
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:58,335
sure you will find your answer or

717
00:32:58,335 --> 00:32:59,385
writing the recommendation

718
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:02,775
and how hard is it to extract

719
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:05,415
data out of the reporting a poi

720
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:08,025
of meadow mo and show it on

721
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:10,905
a webpage like you did it really

722
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,915
depends of the skills you already had

723
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:16,965
so the metamora idea is pretty cool

724
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:20,295
and pretty easy to use and it

725
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:20,685
respect

726
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:22,515
to stand out offer many many a

727
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:24,375
p iso if you're a web developer

728
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,075
you're already familiar with the use age

729
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:30,015
to you the use of apia so

730
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,695
the metal part is not the harder

731
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:33,825
for me i think the hunter is

732
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:37,245
tuned to recreate the interface the interface

733
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:40,125
or in your back of his butt

734
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,095
asking metamora via the ip i to

735
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:45,735
get the data you need is just

736
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:46,125
about

737
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,615
twenty minutes if you have to read

738
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:50,958
the documentation and

739
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:54,255
i think i spend most of my

740
00:33:54,255 --> 00:33:55,305
time about

741
00:33:56,805 --> 00:34:01,455
haters and i will quit requesting to

742
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:02,865
the ip i but not to

743
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:05,835
that is pretty pretty simple to to

744
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,605
set up maybe i will make a

745
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:09,435
video tour to explain how i met

746
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:10,605
him or a p i will work

747
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:13,455
on the tradition that actually it's not

748
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:14,054
so hot

749
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:18,135
and valentin asked a pr is powerful

750
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:19,665
but what are the limits

751
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:23,534
the limits of the ip i and

752
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,625
especially i so that when i when

753
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:28,335
i try to room

754
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:31,725
to create lists so i out on

755
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:32,715
my own back of his i have

756
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:34,815
a list of all my posts with

757
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:38,235

on and the will make

762
00:34:49,815 --> 00:34:53,025
many many regrets mere many requests to

763
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:55,455
metamora for the update were

764
00:34:56,715 --> 00:34:59,865
set on this main page they think

765
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:03,375
the metaphor idea is powerful to send

766
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:06,405
data through metal and to ask them

767
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:10,095
but only in a main entity page

768
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,795

entity but not in a page with

774
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,715
