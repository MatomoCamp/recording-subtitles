1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Exactly, then it starts now. Welcome to the Matomo Compact Workshop.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Maybe for a very short time. What do you expect today? You may have already read it in the description.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So I'll just give you a quick look at the Matomo reports.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Just a brief basic understanding of the individual metrics. What do you find? Where? How can I evaluate what?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We'll take a look at the search log, the behavior reports and the acquisition reports.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Maybe just a quick thing about myself. So I'm Thomas Schernek, I'm a senior SEO and web analyst at an agency in Salzburg and also self-employed.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:00,000
At the same time, in the Matomo universe, I tried to make a few YouTube videos on the topic of Matomo in German with my head.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And if you have any questions, please feel free to chat in the big blue button.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can also mute the questions if there is anything or you want to ask something in the current report.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So we can do a quick Q&A session afterwards. Or you can just ask like this.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or you can just write it later, either in here or just via LinkedIn. That works pretty well too.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then we'll get started. Exactly. How we're going to do that today is we're going to take a look at the Matomo demo page.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you go to the demo.matomo.cloud, you can take a look at the Matomo Cloud version.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So take a look at the demo. There are demo data in there from a fictitious site.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Maybe if you now have On-Premise, so you have installed it yourself,

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
then it will probably only look like this if you have only installed the most common plugins or just that is the basic installation.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We're just going to take a look at the demo page now.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So here are also mostly more plugins installed, which maybe one or the other doesn't have on it.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But that's the version you have when you use, for example, Matomo Cloud.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So we go in and what you see first, so up here is the normal website selection.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So we have different pages that you can select here and depending on that, the complete one changes here.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's similar, I'll tell you now. Maybe one comes from Google Analytics.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's similar to the Analytics data views or properties that you can select here.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The second one is the date picker. Now I have selected the current day today.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can also go here on a weekly basis. You can already notice that complete lines are marked here.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or let's just take a look at the month of October.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Up here there are the segments. So you can segment in Matomo, just like you have segments in Analytics.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There are already a few pre-made segments. At the very beginning you have the one that everyone uses.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's just unfiltered. I'll show you the segments themselves very briefly on the other one.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here you have the option, for example, I have already set up organic search here.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That means the channel type corresponds to, for example, search.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And you can just save and take over that. Click.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The whole thing is so that it takes a while at Matomo Cloud until everything is completely processed,

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
until it can be displayed.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Here we already have something, for example, that means NZ visitors.

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
These are visitors from New Zealand. I can now simply select them here, for example.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If I just go up here, then it's completely selected.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can already see that the visitor card is now changing to New Zealand.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you have the opportunity to compare all the segments together,

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
then you don't go directly to the segment title, but go to this comparison symbol here.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And so you have compared all the visitors to the visitors from New Zealand.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Unfortunately, you can't see much here, because the visitors don't make that much of the total visitors.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Of course, you can also customize this dashboard. That means it's not fixed.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have the option to simply place each widget, these are individual widgets,

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
here somewhere else, for example here on the right.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And then you can already see what you have on every Blanco dashboard.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You always have such a nice welcome screen where you are greeted.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can take a look at that. This is always the first thing I close later.

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Actually, you don't need it anymore. You can simply click away here,

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
confirm briefly that you actually want to take it away now, and then that's it.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you now say, okay, I'm going to have a report here, that's not a problem.

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Here, when you click on it, you have the option to add widgets, different widgets.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And the whole thing is just as integrated as exactly the left tree.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So you have this left menu tree here.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just like here, you also have the different values. Let's take a closer look.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I would now be interested and would like to know, let's take a quick look,

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
which websites the users come to on my page.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then I have the option here that I have inserted the widget right away

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and you can see here that diveadvisor.com, for example, brings the most visitors.

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can customize everything here.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You also have the option to add this dashboard or several dashboards.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You can simply find that down here, for example, change the dashboard layout

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
or you can also add a new dashboard.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Unfortunately, I have to go back to the other demo dashboard, because in the demo,

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you have to know, you can look at a lot of things.

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You actually have view access.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But you can't change a lot, for example, in the demo dashboard.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's just for looking.

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And here, for example, you could also create a new dashboard, just enter the name.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then you have the option, for example, to add the split layout.

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Exactly, add the widgets quickly.

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And then you have the option.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's add it here for a moment.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Exactly, of course, you also have the option to change the split layout.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So that you say, okay, the layout is too strange for me, three splits.

76
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If I have that once, because I just have very few widgets,

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
then I can do it very easily here.

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That would be it in the area of the dashboards that we have here.

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So you can add different dashboards here.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We'll just look at a report.

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That would be the visitor tab, which is always very nice with Matomo.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's probably the case with Google Analytics, that actually the most important metrics,

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
which we list under the reports, for example the visitors,

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
i.e. the properties of the visitors, that you just have them together here.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And the most important metrics are simply listed here.

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And then you can go deeper into the detail later.

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Here we have the graphs of the last visitors on the website itself.

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You also have the option to change the metrics in addition to a line chart.

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So if you say, okay, I'm not interested in the visitors right now,

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I would like to have the pages.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then I just select them.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then they will be compared, for example, or I tick off the visitors, for example.

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Then you can just see the comparison of all the data you have here.

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can also export all the data.

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Here there is another button at the bottom where it says,

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
okay, I want to export the data to another format.

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Here it is always quite good.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So if you make reports or the like,

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I usually use TSV, i.e. also in Excel a good format

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and I usually get all as a drawing limit.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can export that.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you need it theoretically more often, or if you want, for example,

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you can import it into a Google Data Studio.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This may also be possible through an API or an interface.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Then you have different other formats, such as JSON,

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and you can display an export URL.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That means every time it is called, you can export this report here.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What I need for that is an API token that you can create

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
so that you can read the data.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why do I have to do that?

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So that not everyone who calls the URL can just read my data at the same time,

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
but you just need a key for it.

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The possibility, if you can do that graphically,

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you can do a screenshot on the one hand,

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
but the possibility of pulling an export image with Matomo

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
or simply saving with the right mouse button

117
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is also a nice feature you have here.

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Maybe some of you have already noticed all these text boxes.

119
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
These are all the comments you have here.

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So if you go here and say, for example, I have relaunched a website,

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
then I can just leave a comment.

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then I may just have information and say, okay, what happened there?

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why is there a really big drop in the side views,

124
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
almost half down?

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then I can just take a look at it if I want to.

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Exactly, there are all the data and here are the most important metrics.

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's just take a look at them.

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What is very cool in Matomo and what you actually pull through Matomo

129
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
is this visitor log.

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In theory, I can just pull out every user and take a look at it in detail.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I think this visitor log is very, very good

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
because I have detailed information about the user in here

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and I can also see what he is doing exactly.

134
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What he is doing exactly, I'll show you on the other side here in this area.

135
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I now have the option to see on the one hand where the user comes from.

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Here the IP address is anonymized depending on what settings you have given here

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and I can also see the device, operating system and how he came to my website.

138
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Here you can see the campaign is PPC, Pay Per Click.

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How did this happen or how can you do this?

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is actually quite good with Matomo. There is also Google Analytics,

141
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
for example the URL image, so that I can simply overwrite various things

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
such as the source and the medium.

143
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So here, for example, the source Google Ads has simply been overwritten

144
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and the medium is CPC, so Pay Per Click,

145
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and it is simply a Google Ads ad over which the user came here.

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
For example, here the Avengers Playing Cards is simply the first entry point

147
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and then you can just see quite well.

148
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He just clicked through all the pages,

149
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
got stuck with one product and then simply got out again.

150
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There are also, for example, direct access here in this area

151
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
or maybe also access to other search engines such as Ecosia

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and this feature, I just think it's really very good,

153
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
because you can see everything in detail very well.

154
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If you now also click on the visitor profile,

155
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
you still have the opportunity to look.

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is not the case when the user, for example,

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
has come to the page more often.

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's take a quick look.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Do we have someone here?

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Here we don't have any action, unfortunately not.

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What we have seen earlier, the user simply gets on the page

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and when a page call has taken place,

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
you can see it, for example, on this folder symbol.

164
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There are also different categories of events

165
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
that can simply be carried out,

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
for example, an internal search.

167
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
For example, the user simply entered FINS at the top

168
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or, for example, checkout form.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So if someone has taken part in form view,

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
then it is simply displayed here.

171
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The whole e-commerce tracking,

172
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
so if a warning box that was filled before was simply broken down

173
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and events.

174
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So events are actually almost the same as with Google Analytics.

175
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You can also send additional data to Matomo itself,

176
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
which you can then select all of them later.

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So.

178
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Then let's just look further.

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, the real-time report is always very nice.

180
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So you can always see when something comes in at the top.

181
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But this is not so targeted for a detailed analysis.

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The visitor card in real time is also a nice feature

183
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
where you can just see where all the users come from on my website.

184
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It gets really interesting with the local report.

185
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Here you can see different widgets.

186
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
For example, I can now go directly into the United States

187
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and with the mouse over I can then just see

188
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
how many visitors really came from the United States.

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It then covers itself with this area here on the right.

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And now I'll show you something again.

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Here you can still see a segmented visitor log

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
in all the metrics.

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This means that this visitor log, as I said earlier,

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
is pulled through the whole of Matomo.

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now I have simply filtered the visitor log

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
onto the United States of America

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and can evaluate it in detail quite well.

198
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't have to segment something in detail beforehand,

199
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
but just take the pre-made segments from Matomo,

200
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
for example, that it is now filtered onto the land,

201
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
take it and can then evaluate it completely.

202
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The tab is also very extensive,

203
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
more extensive, I would say, like in analytics.

204
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So we have here next to desktop, tablet and smartphone

205
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
we also have different other devices,

206
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
for example game consoles,

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
which for example come to the website.

208
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Here as a reference, for example, from Reddit directly on the website

209
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
on a game console.

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is also an interesting feature.

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Here you also have more information.

212
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Of course, device models can also be completely evaluated here.

213
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The brands, depending on whether they manage to do it or not,

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
so if it is unknown, then there is simply no

215
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
allocation in Matomo in this area,

216
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
which is also quite good for responsive design.

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can also take a look here,

218
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
how many users are accessing, with which resolution,

219
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
this is actually a very good metric.

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Software, which is probably now only there

221
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
so that you can just take a look

222
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
at what kind of browser support I have to offer as a website operator.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Do I still have to go there and say,

224
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
okay, I have the Internet Explorer,

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
do I still have to offer an older version?

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is a nice feature.

227
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The times, there are always two things.

228
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
There is simply the visit to local time,

229
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
that is, let's assume my server is now in New York

230
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and I arrive at 8 o'clock Central European Summer Time,

231
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
then I would probably be tracked in here.

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The server time can be completely different,

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
for example here.

234
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is actually very useful when you say,

235
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
okay, you have a high server load in several time zones,

236
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
maybe then combined.

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That means, okay, in the morning I have a lot of traffic

238
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and in the evening I have a lot of traffic for the server

239
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
in different time zones, for example,

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
then built-in traffic to server time.

241
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So that's always the time when the user looks at the page

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and that's where the server has the location

243
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and where the call is generated.

244
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If you, for example, are a website operator

245
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and you have an online shop where users can register,

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
there is the possibility to give the user ID directly.

247
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Whether the DSGVO is technically okay or not,

248
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
unfortunately I can't answer that here,

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
but it is possible that you, for example,

250
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
give email addresses or user string here and there.

251
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Then you have the opportunity and can, for example,

252
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
look at what a big tank has here for the visitor profile.

253
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
For example, he has come up here very often on the website

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and what he has looked at at all.

255
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's actually very good what you just have with you.

256
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you have the shop, you can give it bundled.

257
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can also give different other variables.

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's say you have a blog and you have different authors

259
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and you can also, so you could now,

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
by adjusting the tracking script format a little bit.

261
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How to do that is usually found here under the help items.

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's always very good if you don't know which one,

263
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
what kind of metric that is, what it's about,

264
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you have the opportunity to always show it here either

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
through the mouse over or to look at the documentation

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
or an instruction.

267
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So now you have to give my tracking code.

268
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That means if I call a blog post and a certain author

269
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
has written it, for example Charles,

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
then it is simply given next to the URL, the type and so on,

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
as a user-defined variable.

272
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's actually a very good thing,

273
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
how you could add your data, for example.

274
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Exactly, that would be it for the part,

275
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
for the visitor part.

276
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Do you already have any questions in this area?

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Otherwise, I'll just keep looking.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Otherwise, always feel free to ask questions.

279
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Otherwise, we'll just keep going and take a look at the other two reports,

280
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
namely the behavior.

281
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
When it comes to behavior, it's really about the page itself.

282
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Here you simply have the most important metrics,

283
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
page views, clear page views,

284
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
two metrics, why are they so different?

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Well, of course, I can call five times in one session, for example,

286
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
one page, then I have a page view of five

287
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and clearly one, because I just called it once in the session.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And all the metrics such as jump rate and how long

289
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
do you stay on this page on average?

290
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Here you can simply see that bundled based on the folder structure.

291
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That means, if I just look at it here,

292
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
then it's just slash diving, slash and everything that happens behind it.

293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So it's actually like the report in analytics for content pages.

294
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If you don't like it now, you can go all the way down

295
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and say, okay, I'd like to structure this one

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
not hierarchically, but I just want to show it flat.

297
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So flat simply means the first level

298
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
or every page URL is simply displayed in detail.

299
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And now I just have the individual pages here.

300
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Of course, you can also call me when I go up here

301
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and then I have my page ready.

302
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The entry pages are the landing pages.

303
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Here it's just about how the user gets on the page,

304
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
what is the first page when he comes to your page

305
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and exactly those are the pages that are listed under entry pages.

306
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
In other words, exit pages,

307
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you can probably already think of them as the pages

308
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
where you're done with the whole session and where you just stop.

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That means closing the browser is the exit page.

310
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you say, okay, I don't want to look at the URLs anymore,

311
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I just want to see the title, then you have the title here,

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
but that's always very important.

313
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I change the title once, then I have, for example, two cards

314
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and the other title would have to be combined again.

315
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's why the URL is actually very good for evaluating

316
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and very important that you just do it really URL-based.

317
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The internal book, you can also do that by, for example, adjusting it.

318
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
On the one hand, there is the tracking script,

319
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
on the other hand, I can go into the settings and say,

320
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I want such common parameters.

321
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
In WordPress, I think it's S or Q that are attached

322
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and then it's just left behind.

323
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So if you're looking for something in WordPress,

324
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
for example, here floats and then press enter,

325
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
then it's really in the URL,

326
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that's then S equals floats and that after the is equals

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
it comes in directly.

328
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
These are the search terms and when you search, for example,

329
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
then you just look at what happens after that.

330
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's pretty good, maybe a little SEO tip.

331
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's face it, very often something is searched

332
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and you don't have it in the menu,

333
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it might be worthwhile to pick up this site prominently.

334
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You may also come to new keywords,

335
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
which you may not have thought of yet,

336
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
which you may then be able to integrate in certain subfolders.

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What is also a very cool feature,

338
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
but you also have to ask the technology

339
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
whether this is implemented,

340
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that's just for an additional call.

341
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What happens if the user is looking for something

342
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and there are simply zero results?

343
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
If it happens too often,

344
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
then just put a new page on it.

345
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That's actually very good in Matoma,

346
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
you can also go in and take a look at it completely.

347
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
In that area.

348
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
If you now go to the settings,

349
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
simply put your domain,

350
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
then you also have the opportunity to see

351
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
where the users go afterwards.

352
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So what is the next click?

353
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
There is click tracking on external domains.

354
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Here, for example, there is LiveAboard

355
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and I also have the opportunity

356
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
to turn it off if this is based on a domain again.

357
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If, for example,

358
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
different URLs of a domain are grouped again.

359
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Of course, I can also display it flat again,

360
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
not hierarchically.

361
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And then I also have the opportunity

362
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to look here in detail

363
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
where this link was clicked.

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
This is a link click here.

365
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And at the same time,

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
it is also set as a goal.

367
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's also a great thing.

368
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Maybe that's also quite good.

369
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You have certain partners and say,

370
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
OK, you can link a banner with us.

371
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Then you actually have a statistic at the same time

372
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
how often a banner was clicked

373
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
to an external partner, for example,

374
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
if you need it.

375
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
There is also download tracking on the fly.

376
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That means, it is simply looked at.

377
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Is it PDF, DocX, also JPEGs,

378
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
depending on the one.

379
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You can also add more in the tracking codes

380
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and then the downloads are simply tracked.

381
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It is important to know that a download tracking

382
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
is not something like this

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
if I would call this URL directly.

384
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then it is not tracked.

385
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Why is it not tracked?

386
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Because no JavaScript code can be

387
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
executed, for example,

388
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or in a PDF, actually not.

389
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And that's why the call is not tracked,

390
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
but actually just the click to the document on the website.

391
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's actually quite good or important to know

392
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
in that area.

393
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
At the front you have the events.

394
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That means you have events that you can

395
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
additionally send in that area.

396
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Here, for example, click tracking was also

397
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
integrated as an event category.

398
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That's back to top.

399
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You can look at this again with the segmented

400
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
visitor log.

401
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Where is that about?

402
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
For example, on this register page,

403
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
there is simply apparently a back to top button

404
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that you can track.

405
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Click tracking can then usually be done

406
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
quite well with the Atomo Tag Manager.

407
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
When it is integrated, there are already

408
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
good templates, how you can do it.

409
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We'll take a closer look at the content.

410
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Then we also have content areas,

411
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
which you can add here.

412
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's also a good feature, but you have to

413
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
define it beforehand.

414
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Very well, we'll take a closer look at

415
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
engagement.

416
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
These are all metrics,

417
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
average duration of time,

418
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
how many actions were carried out at all,

419
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
how often a certain user comes back to the

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
page, how many pages will be in the

421
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
section.

422
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
These are all metrics that you can

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
look at bundled there.

424
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let's take a look at the visitor flow.

425
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's also a very good chart.

426
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Here you can just look at it.

427
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If someone goes to the job page,

428
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
for example, there are 59% exits.

429
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But where do all the other exits really go?

430
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So where does the user really go later,

431
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
on which pages?

432
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It actually visualizes quite well.

433
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This is also a feature, for example.

434
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There is now only either cloud hosted or

435
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
is just a premium plugin from Atomo.

436
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's why I don't want to go that far

437
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
because I don't know if any of you have

438
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
this feature.

439
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Down here we have our user-defined

440
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
variables, as we have already seen before.

441
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
This is, for example, the page authors.

442
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
They are listed down here.

443
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Acquisition report.

444
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
How do the users come to our site?

445
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So here we have again in the overview,

446
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
as well as listed everywhere,

447
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
the different channel types.

448
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Direct search engines, social networks,

449
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
websites and campaigns.

450
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The whole thing is again

451
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
opened up to channel type.

452
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
For example, search engines.

453
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Then the search terms are possibly

454
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
displayed here.

455
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But I wouldn't leave myself 100% on it now.

456
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
For example, this is hardly any more.

457
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
These are not provided.

458
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Actually, 95% of clicks from search engines

459
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
don't include keywords.

460
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So it's not that someone just says,

461
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
OK, there are 53,000 visitors

462
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and that's 319 times the search term.

463
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Maybe it's the one that is searched most often.

464
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just recommend to just look

465
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
into the search console.

466
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Search data.

467
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Then we look again at all channels.

468
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Here we have again the different channels

469
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
simply opened up.

470
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
For example, also the reference search engines

471
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and search terms.

472
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Here it would be all in detail,

473
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
what we saw earlier,

474
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
opened up.

475
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Also quite good, I think,

476
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
this search engine distribution

477
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
and at Matomo also a big pro feature

478
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
that there are icons everywhere.

479
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You also have the option to export it well

480
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and then show yourself completely

481
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
in the diagram.

482
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We go again briefly.

483
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
These are the different search terms

484
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
for the different search engines.

485
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

486
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
For the websites,

487
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
it's about who refers to me

488
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
or how many users come from certain websites

489
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
to my website,

490
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
as well as social media networks.

491
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Which ones are there at all

492
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and how do the different users get there?

493
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
For example, Reddit is very much in demand here

494
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and if I have campaigns myself.

495
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
With the campaigns it is now like this.

496
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
On the one hand, there is this campaign name

497
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
theoretically the keyword and so on

498
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and down here there is a campaign URL generator.

499
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
If I go on it now,

500
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I can build what is later in the campaigns

501
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
myself.

502
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That means I just put my URL in here

503
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and say, okay, take my campaign name,

504
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
for example, go here and say,

505
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
okay, source medium.

506
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So where does it all come from?

507
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
If I say, okay, this is for example

508
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
a newsletter, the medium is email,

509
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
then I can enter it here and then I have it later

510
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
here in my campaign report search terms

511
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and well, there is now unfortunately

512
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
no more data in this demo,

513
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
but then I would have everything compact here.

514
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's why my appeal.

515
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
There are a lot of channels

516
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
where it is called the direct traffic,

517
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
direct none may still be known by one or the other

518
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
from analytics. This is usually actually this

519
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
starting point of the traffic that is not assignable.

520
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So partly these are users who enter something at the top,

521
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
partly but also users who click on a link

522
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
from the email program. It is always very important

523
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
that you, for example, send a signature or newsletter

524
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
such a campaign URL is generated.

525
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
This is then the URL and behind it are the whole,

526
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
for example, what is this really for a source,

527
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
what is for a medium and then it comes, for example,

528
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
here with somewhere else and not under direct

529
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
traffic. This is actually very important, because otherwise

530
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you are a bit thrown away.

531
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
There are different scenarios. Here you are also talking about

532
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
QR code. If I want to evaluate a QR code,

533
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I also have to create a campaign URL,

534
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
because otherwise nothing else remains.

535
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Actually nothing else remains,

536
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
because I don't know how the users come to the side

537
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and I can only do that by creating

538
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
a campaign URL.

539
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
If you have a shop,

540
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
you also have the opportunity to track the complete sales

541
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
with e-commerce tracking.

542
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Here again the course of the orders

543
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and you can easily see

544
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
the conversion rate, which is very important.

545
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And you can also

546
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
look at it with the expanded e-commerce tracking.

547
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Where are the warning boxes left at all?

548
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
For example, users are added,

549
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
but never bought, then everything can be

550
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
completely in here. What is very good,

551
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
you now have the e-commerce protocol again.

552
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
For example, the visitor log

553
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
is only filtered to e-commerce activities.

554
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You can also look at it again.

555
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Here you can see all the complete data again.

556
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
As I said, e-commerce tracking is another league again.

557
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You have to implement and test it

558
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
from the development department.

559
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But it is actually a very good feature

560
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
that you have all the most important information here.

561
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What does my shop even bring?

562
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Exactly, you can test it again.

563
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
These are the product data,

564
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
as well as the turnover. With the turnover,

565
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
it is again the case that you go really deeper

566
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
in the Atomo and have the opportunity.

567
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You can look at the turnover by channel types.

568
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
There I have the opportunity to say,

569
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
where do I invest more? Here, for example,

570
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
the network has simply made the most traffic

571
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
in the CEO, rather the least.

572
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It may be that I, for example,

573
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
put a little something in here in social advertising

574
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and there are a lot of things that you can then

575
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
evaluate directly here. Even if I have

576
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
certain campaigns here, for example,

577
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I probably don't have any campaign names now.

578
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I also have the option,

579
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
for example, if I have a company that doesn't tell me any names,

580
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I can maybe think about whether

581
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I might switch it off in that area.

582
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
What is a website without goals?

583
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Actually, without goals,

584
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
a website should never go online,

585
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
because each website follows a goal.

586
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And here you can enter different goals

587
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and also follow them.

588
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
For example, I have a website

589
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
with a number of conversions

590
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
that you have in this area.

591
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And that is actually an important thing

592
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that you have to manage the goals.

593
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Let's take a quick look here again.

594
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Unfortunately, I can only manage the goals

595
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
if I manage the goals myself.

596
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You can simply define a completely normal new goal.

597
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
For example, I want to have a website with a certain title.

598
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I can do it by event.

599
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I can download a certain file, for example.

600
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
If I say, OK, I want to have this goal,

601
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
a certain click on the link on the external page.

602
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's like the example before.

603
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
For example, I offer banner places

604
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and say, OK, banner place XY.

605
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I just want to take a look at how often, for example,

606
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
there is a conversion rate.

607
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Then I can simply set a goal,

608
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
just like for a while.

609
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And then I have the opportunity to simply

610
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
add that directly.

611
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's actually a very good thing that you have here.

612
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Now in the normal Matomo,

613
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
that would still be in that area.

614
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
We have five minutes left. I'll show you the premium plugins

615
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
that you have at Matomo Cloud.

616
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
There are the funnels.

617
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The funnels actually build on the goals.

618
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I can define a funnel for each goal.

619
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That means I have the option here

620
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
to define different steps in the job application form.

621
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's just saying, OK,

622
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
where do the users come from on the job board?

623
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
How far do they go?

624
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
For example, a little less jump here

625
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
further.

626
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Then a job is simply looked at

627
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and will really apply for this job.

628
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That means we have a conversion rate of 0.8.

629
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Why is that?

630
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes, well, I have about 600,

631
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
6500 entries up here

632
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and down here 52 conversions.

633
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
That's a nice plugin

634
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
that you still have here.

635
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Either the Cloud Hosted Plan or you can

636
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
have a look at it in the Matomo Marketplace

637
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and then

638
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
buy it.

639
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
For four users it costs,

640
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'll give you a tip, that's 179 euros per year.

641
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
If you need several plugins,

642
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
then most of the time

643
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
a Matomo Cloud version is enough.

644
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
If you just go with it

645
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and take a look at Matomo

646
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and then

647
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
if you go up here again

648
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and then look at the prices,

649
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
no, they are somewhere else,

650
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
pricing here and say, OK,

651
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
let's take a look at the other website

652
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and then we would be

653
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
with the Cloud Hosting 19 euros

654
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
quite well, depending on how big the site is.

655
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You can here, for example, 35 euros,

656
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
if you now counter it and say, OK,

657
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
you have 100,000, 35 euros would be

658
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
say 400 euros a year, 400, 500 euros a year.

659
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That's actually the price for three

660
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
plugins.

661
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
This is the Activity Log, for example,

662
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Funnels, which you have with you.

663
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You can do the complete white labeling and these custom reports.

664
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Just like this form, form tracking

665
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
is also very good for you. Now I can only recommend

666
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
this form tracking is,

667
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
every form is automatically

668
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
measured by Matomo and

669
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
here as a form.

670
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And then you can just look at it, when you have

671
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Apply to Job form. What is the starter rate?

672
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The starter rate is simply when something is clicked.

673
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So when the focus is set in the form,

674
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
the first time with the form is entered

675
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and you have such a submission rate is actually

676
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
also a very good plugin,

677
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
what you have with you here. Media,

678
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
for example, video, audio, player, YouTube

679
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
like Meo or Selfhost, which you want to analyze.

680
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Then you actually have it here with you, you have the title,

681
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
you do the video resource,

682
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
great feature, A-B testing,

683
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
of course two versions against each other,

684
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
heatmaps, as you normally know them,

685
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
fail to load,

686
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
it doesn't work right now,

687
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
but most of the time it does.

688
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What we then have the option,

689
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
are these session recordings, here the real click

690
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
is recorded. Let's take a quick look at it here.

691
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So we have something here

692
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
that you should normally deactivate.

693
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So you can just take a look at it,

694
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
how does the user click, what is the mouse interaction

695
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and so on.

696
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
A great feature, if you really want to try things out

697
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
or want to measure how something pops up dynamically

698
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
or works, I can only recommend

699
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
user-defined reports.

700
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
If you have any report, you can build it yourself here,

701
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
it is then simply calculated

702
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and you can then display different metrics against each other.

703
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This is also a very, very good

704
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
report.

705
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Exactly, now it is

706
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that we are actually at the end

707
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
in this area.

708
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You can now also ask questions,

709
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
be it in the chats or here, you can also unmute

710
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
if you want to and then just directly

711
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
ask, if you have any questions.

712
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But let's take a quick look.

713
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Now let's take a quick look at Melanie.

714
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I have a question about the period reports

715
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
for search terms without results.

716
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So internal searches, exactly, the monthly reports

717
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
deliver less hits than the daily reports

718
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
in the respective month. So how can it be?

719
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Does the aggregation not work

720
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
or do I still understand the report wrong?

721
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You have to take a look at that now.

722
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't have it on a specific

723
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
example.

724
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Let's take a quick look

725
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
at that.

726
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I hope I can actually

727
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
replicate it here. That means

728
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
you actually mean for October

729
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
the visits for internal search questions.

730
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I don't know if you mean that.

731
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You can also

732
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
take a quick look

733
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
at the reports.

734
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Let's take a quick look

735
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
at that.

736
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Exactly, search the reports without results.

737
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So that here, actually, if I take the daily ones

738
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
together and then actually the aggregated months

739
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
are different. Normally that shouldn't be the case.

740
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You probably have to take a closer look at

741
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
why that's the case.

742
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Actually, that shouldn't be the case

743
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
normally. But you can

744
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
take a look. We can take a video session

745
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
afterwards. I'll just take a closer look

746
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
at where the problem might be

747
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
if that's okay for you.

748
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Exactly.

749
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Then we'll just do it that way. Just message me.

750
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Exactly.

751
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Otherwise...

752
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Otherwise,

753
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I hope I could give you a good

754
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
overview of the questions.

755
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
About the different reports.

756
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If you have any questions, feel free to come in here.

757
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
If you have any questions,

758
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I can tell you how I did it back then.

759
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
There's the Matomo Forum. Lucas was there as well.

760
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
He also helped me a lot.

761
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It's a Matomo Forum.

762
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
There's even a German forum.

763
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can post something there as well.

764
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It also helps a lot if you have the cloud version.

765
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
There's even a Patomo support.

766
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
There are videos. There are English videos.

767
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I also have a few videos.

768
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What else is there? Exactly. Lucas is still writing

769
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
a Q&A session at 4 p.m.

770
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
There's Melanie.

771
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That's in English. Could you possibly

772
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
take that with you?

773
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
For example, if there's a problem,

774
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
you can also ask good questions.

775
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You can also ask questions.

776
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
If you're interested,

777
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
you can also ask questions.

778
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:01,000
There's also the

779
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Techmanage integration.

780
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Self-hosted and so on.

781
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's about the five experts.

782
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We'll see each other in 10 minutes.

783
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Feel free to switch into the Q&A session.

784
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Maybe Lucas will post a link

785
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
so you can chat in that area

786
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
right away.

787
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Thank you for listening, for staying tuned.

788
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
There are almost 20 people.

789
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I was very happy. If there's anything else,

790
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
just write to us.

791
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
There are no stupid questions.

792
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Just don't be shy to write to us.

793
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We can look at it together

794
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and solve everything together.

795
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I wish you a very nice day.

796
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Thank you for your time here at the Matomo Camp.

797
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Tomorrow is another day.

798
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Take a look at a lot of interesting presentations.

799
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Take care and stay healthy.

800
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Bye!
