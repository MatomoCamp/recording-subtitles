and with that it's time for the

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,070
next session

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,770
for this i would like to introduce

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,260
Silva Arapi she is a

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,440
co-founders of Cloud68.co

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,720
working to make the use

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
of open source digital infrastructure easy and convenient

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,280
in her talk how

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,530
to stay compliant with privacy regulations with

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,020
Matomo analytics to recover the importance of

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,380
compliance with privacy regulations especially for business

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,320
perspective and how matomo analytics makes it

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,330
easy for people to ensure the privacy

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,520
of the visitors for this to regain

19
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:53,160
all their comparison with google analytics and

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,060
with that take away

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,660
many thanks for the introduction michael's hello

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,500
everyone i'm very excited to join this

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,510
very first event of matthew camp today

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,210
as marcus mentioned i will be speaking

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,330
about compliance with

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,830
privacy regulations by using digital analytics tool

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,230
such as mega man olympics

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,500
i have a quick look into the

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,340
agenda for today i will quickly go

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,180
over

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,460
the discussion about personal data why

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,560
are so many regulations in place in

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,900
order to safeguard this data from

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,970
the companies let's say for a while

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,770
hosting personal data we will go through

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,260
the alternatives that we have when it

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,770
comes to using digital analytics tools such

38
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,030
as google analytics madam analytics which will

39
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,200
be made the

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,699
the main focus of this event but

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,460
of course there are also other tools

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,130
out there which you can use and

43
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,940
then we will go over the main

44
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,540
requirements requirements of gdp are and we

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,390
will look into the tools that moto

46
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,270
mo provides us with which

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,260
it helps us which support us to

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,810
respond to the requests of data subjects

49
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,380
and as a consequence that makes compliance

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,130
easier

51
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,490
so a few words about me i

52
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,640
am a free software and online privacy

53
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,830
advocate at least this is what i

54
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:56,010
do on a volunteer level i am

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,710
a board member of open labs hackerspace

56
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,400
and in tirana albania and

57
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,950
ngo where i have contributed for the

58
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,996
last couple of fears and where i

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,890
had the opportunity to learn about the

60
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,740
free software movement and since then i've

61
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,840
been engaged in various small open source

62
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,560
projects software i've mainly been engaged

63
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,640
with advocacy and with a special focus

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,610
on the topic of online privacy i'm

65
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,190
also one of the co-founders of clouds

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,150
is sixty eight a company which supports

67
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,280
all their small teams to make use

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,130
of free and open source software

69
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:42,980
i

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,810
i have been using matomo in the

71
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,020
last two years maybe have despite the

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,510
fact that i haven't used it in

73
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,360
a set up where we would handle

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,420
like a huge amount of data either

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,090
close it or closely looked into it

76
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,080
as an alternative of google analytics

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,650
and which of course and not only

78
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,270
makes compliance

79
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,060
easier but has many other advantages compared

80
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,579
to this proprietary tool which i will

81
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,330
try to go into more detail later

82
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,800
during this presentation

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,840
and so i'm sure that everyone who

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,930
is hearing this session now couldn't have

85
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,170
missed a hearing the expression that data

86
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,094
is the new oil we hear this

87
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,400
spread pretty often maybe in the last

88
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,040
decade and since

89
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,670
two thousand two thousand and thirteen with

90
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,663
the edward snowden reveal the asians about

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,070
how personal data was being mishandled not

92
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,230
one hundred not only from companies but

93
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,470
also from government bodies there has been

94
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,760
a lot of discussion and many other

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,600
cases of data breaches have been published

96
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,880
which created an increase

97
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,790
this need for a public debate about

98
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,730
how companies were storing personal data how

99
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,010
they were processing it how much data

100
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,820
they were holding and how much information

101
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,622
does the public have about this and

102
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,040
this increase of

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,890
of of the cases of abuse we

104
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,740
can say have increased also the need

105
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:46,350
from public bodies to create proper legislations

106
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,300
on the ways how do these companies

107
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,490
should handle the data and how they

108
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,140
should also take measures

109
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,540
to to protect it and to not

110
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,530
abuse with it

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,790
the reason why companies are so eager

112
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,000
to collect as much data as possible

113
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,590
because is because of courses this expression

114
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,380
says the data is then it means

115
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:13,770
that

116
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,730
there is also there are also lots

117
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,460
of profits about collecting and making use

118
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,780
of the of the data

119
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,280
so this is why it's really important

120
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,050
to have proper legislation in place and

121
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,730
to how to hold these companies accountable

122
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,050
about their actions

123
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,560
so privacy compliance

124
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,040
i have a very short definition of

125
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,410
the term is that it is accompanies

126
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,460
accordance with established personal information protection guidelines

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,900
specifications or legislations good but depending on

128
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,667
your country where you are operating or

129
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,290
where your customer base is that you

130
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,800
might face

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,870
calling two different regulation regulations so this

132
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,110
is a case by case this can

133
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,610
be treated on a case by case

134
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,620
scenario but two of the most not

135
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,270
only popular but also more strict regulations

136
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,960
is in play

137
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,140
these are the european general data protection

138
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,170
regulation dpr through which also during this

139
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,510
presentation we will look into more detail

140
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,390
but also the ccp a which is

141
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,980
california's customer privacy act both are designed

142
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,000
to protect unauthorized access to what's called

143
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,110
personally identifiable information with which we will

144
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,430
also define in the

145
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,510
upcoming slides and so basically this presentation

146
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,950
will mainly be designed for those companies

147
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,830
who are gathering personal data of individuals

148
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,581
who are performing digital analytics but i

149
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,390
are also looking for tools which will

150
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,900
support them to stay compliant with this

151
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,430
virus regulations

152
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,170
and so despite the fact that there

153
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,710
is like there has there has been

154
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,500
this long discussion and abuse about the

155
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,140
misuse of personal data at the end

156
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,260
companies also need to collect it because

157
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,760
it's also way to

158
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,190
to serve their customers to improve their

159
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,860
experiences to perform innovation and so the

160
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,860
main considerations here is that we should

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,090
perform digital analytics actions in this gdp

162
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,360
our era by having like ethics in

163
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,740
mind and by

164
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,680
complying and by using the right tools

165
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,630
which support our ethics

166
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,740
and so as i mention why while

167
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,940
there are virus

168
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:19,080
regulations in place one of the most

169
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,320
streak that most discussed wants is that

170
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,850
european gdp are which requires all companies

171
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,039
despite the fact if they are in

172
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,740
basing the eu or not if they

173
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,240
are serving to eel based citizens

174
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,420
yes

175
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,990
they will have to comply this is

176
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,950
a regulations which strengthens and unifies that

177
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,490
data protection from for all individuals within

178
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,240
the eu

179
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,060
and the this regulation of course is

180
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,100
quite complex and if we well to

181
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,660
go and dig way way much deeper

182
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,020
of course we would need the support

183
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,100
of

184
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,665
what consultants do

185
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:16,255
so to discuss like everything related to

186
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:20,455
it but in a more or if

187
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:22,825
we were to explain it very easily

188
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,185
it is applicable to accompany every time

189
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,825
that it is collecting personal data if

190
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,345
you're starting from personal data of this

191
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:32,905
individuals then you have to come

192
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:36,895
comply with the data protection principles which

193
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:40,435
are guided by the duty pr so

194
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:42,595
of course in order to collect this

195
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:45,145
data you should also have a legal

196
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,745
basis for doing so you should always

197
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:52,405
communicate this legal basis to your users

198
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:53,065
which are called

199
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:56,305
the data subjects and so they should

200
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:59,095
be always informed about the type of

201
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,675
data that you are collecting about them

202
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:03,955
and why do you need this data

203
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:07,345
and of course they show they have

204
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:11,455
various rights upon this data which again

205
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,225
we will look into more

206
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,065
details

207
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:21,505
and an important aspect of the gdp

208
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:22,525
art is that

209
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:27,955
it also included some other identifiers in

210
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:32,305
the concept of personal data and for

211
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:36,175
example ip addresses if an ip address

212
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:40,735
can be used to uniquely identify a

213
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:43,615
person this under the gdp are this

214
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:43,705
is

215
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:49,045
also i consider the personal information and

216
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:54,085
personal data so it's not enough to

217
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:56,755
have like very concrete information about the

218
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:58,825
person which falls under the pii such

219
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:01,405
as their name their home address their

220
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,205
email address but if

221
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:07,885
the there are some sort of third

222
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:10,915
party identifiers which you can use to

223
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:15,115
match and two in in in in

224
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:18,715
another way to identify a person's identity

225
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,385
that falls under the personal data and

226
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,995
here we include ip addresses

227
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:26,121
located in the fire spades you are

228
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:30,475
else or page titles user ids e-commerce

229
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:33,625
or derive these locations and heatmaps and

230
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,745
session recordings so this is a this

231
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:38,935
was a major upgrade with a gdp

232
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:42,535
iron to to also include this kind

233
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:44,185
of identifiers a spa

234
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:46,525
i have the legislation so every time

235
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,805
that you are collecting this information you

236
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:51,625
should meet make sure that you are

237
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:55,465
following all of the gdp our guidelines

238
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:02,725
so when and especially in the case

239
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:05,155
of small companies who do not have

240
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,484
all of the resources to go over

241
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,065
very careful

242
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:14,005
and

243
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:18,805
check of their internal procedures they should

244
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,965
try to minimize as much as possible

245
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:26,305
look the amount of data the amount

246
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,075
of personal data that they are set

247
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:32,215
saving about their individuals and when possible

248
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,495
if they do not really need it

249
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:35,305
they should

250
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:36,445
should do

251
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:40,855
completely avoid doing so and of course

252
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:44,455
there are ways for example if in

253
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:48,145
your website you are hosting the digital

254
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:50,875
analytics solution but you are mainly interested

255
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,755
in analyzing the user behavior but you

256
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,975
don't really need to know who this

257
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:57,625
user sar than you

258
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,995
should make sure to configure your tools

259
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:02,065
in the right way so you so

260
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,165
that you just get the information that

261
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:07,345
you need but without a whole thing

262
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:12,025
any type of personal information about your

263
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:12,925
visitors

264
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,395
so in this way you will save

265
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,885
your two herself a lot of time

266
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:23,905
and resources and which can be which

267
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,245
you otherwise would have to dedicate to

268
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,665
communicate what kind of data you use

269
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:33,175
you are hosting through your privacy policy

270
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,105
and all

271
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,745
also to comply with the data subject's

272
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:39,145
request so in every scenario when you

273
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,815
can avoid that so all of hosting

274
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,685
personal data you should consider doing so

275
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:53,665
and also another benefit let's say of

276
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,185
not tossing personal data when that is

277
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:57,025
possible

278
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,165
and which you can achieved by using

279
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:03,715
up like matomo as we will see

280
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:06,025
later is that you can configure it

281
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,525
in a way so that you can

282
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:11,035
also avoid the constant screens which are

283
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,345
to those annoying screens that we see

284
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,475
every time that we open a new

285
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:18,265
website full asks i will inform sir

286
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:21,925
about cookies and the data that they

287
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:26,695
are storing because this has proved to

288
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:30,565
also impact the customer experience so if

289
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:32,665
you can in a way avoid this

290
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,535
at a wall

291
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:38,785
that can also be beneficial for for

292
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,765
your business purposes as well

293
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:49,285
moto mod actually provides a way for

294
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,715
for you to achieve this so in

295
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:54,955
the case that and you do not

296
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,235
track personal data and you also have

297
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:59,845
a need to have enabled calculus tracking

298
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:01,435
you can

299
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:05,995
bypass this requirement which is quite usual

300
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:08,696
by legislation such as gdp yard and

301
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:12,565
the privacy to display this banner asking

302
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:15,565
for cookie or tracking consent

303
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,685
the reason why with matomo this is

304
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:23,905
possible is that visitors aren't tracked across

305
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:26,995
various websites as it happens in the

306
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:31,135
case of the google analytics visitors can

307
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:34,405
be tracked within different days so we

308
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:36,745
know the timeframe of matter

309
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,575
obama does not do

310
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,195
perform profiling of visitors and of course

311
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:45,805
other data can be used for your

312
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,795
own purposes and not for other purposes

313
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,775
such as in the case of google

314
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,935
analytics with whom if you share the

315
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:56,785
data they can also use it use

316
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:59,785
it for their own

317
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:00,895
offerings

318
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:06,295
and

319
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:11,454
an important consideration under the gdp are

320
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:14,815
are the rights of other data subjects

321
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:17,425
for the people to whom you are

322
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:20,425
hosting this personal data either the gdp

323
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:23,335
are they have various rights which they

324
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:27,625
can exercise anytime and inara

325
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:30,145
drip to stay compliant you will need

326
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:33,295
to have the necessary tools to respond

327
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:36,205
and to perform this request by your

328
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:40,015
data subjects some of this er rights

329
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,755
are the right to be informed you

330
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:46,705
have to always communicate and the kind

331
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:47,785
of personal data

332
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:50,005
you are collecting through through a privacy

333
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:53,935
policy at least this is the most

334
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:57,175
usual way to communicate this to your

335
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:59,875
users they have the right to access

336
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,305
this data so they can ask for

337
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:05,095
you all of this information and you

338
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:06,595
will have to share it with them

339
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:07,945
they have the right

340
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,825
to ask for erasure of the data

341
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,716
they have the right to ask for

342
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,755
a modification the that they they they

343
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:16,315
pretend that the data that you are

344
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:18,805
hosting is not correct or net needs

345
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:21,235
to be updated they have the right

346
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:24,175
for date of birth of ability which

347
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:26,245
means that in some cases they might

348
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,105
ask for this day

349
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:29,935
data and you will have to send

350
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,185
them send it to them in a

351
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:38,575
machine readable format which they can easily

352
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,175
use afterwards they also have the right

353
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:44,965
to object this mainly happens in the

354
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:46,885
case where you are not asking for

355
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,259
consent but you

356
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:51,835
or performing the data collection under the

357
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:55,255
legal basis of legitimate interest and in

358
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:58,255
this case your users might have the

359
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:01,045
right to object or the data collection

360
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:05,725
and of course in the case that

361
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:08,335
you are asking for consent they have

362
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:10,975
the right to withdraw consent and usually

363
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,635
it's advisable to offer an opt out

364
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:19,495
option which is easily accessible by your

365
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,085
data subjects

366
00:19:23,215 --> 00:19:26,365
all of these specifications

367
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:31,075
under the gdp are put a lot

368
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:34,165
of pressure on companies of all sizes

369
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:36,655
because no matter of the size of

370
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,055
the company they have to make sure

371
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,545
that they are respecting this personal data

372
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:43,825
so they need to take all the

373
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:46,255
appropriate measures to stay compliant

374
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:52,885
this requires additional resources additional more and

375
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:57,205
education within organizations to also train their

376
00:19:57,205 --> 00:20:00,805
internal staff and to design all the

377
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:07,465
organizational procedures with the data protection principles

378
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:08,305
in mind

379
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:15,355
so with this being said you when

380
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:20,365
it comes to making the decision about

381
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,465
your do

382
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,450
digital analytics tool you might have to

383
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,580
go through a decision making process when

384
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,270
choosing the right and appropriate goals and

385
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,100
as i mentioned during this presentation we

386
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,470
will mainly go over the compression of

387
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:43,961
a google

388
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,620
politics and madame analytics and why i

389
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,440
believe that matthau moist bathroom for privacy

390
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,710
compliance but of course there are plenty

391
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,220
of tools out there the only thing

392
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,160
that i would suggest is that when

393
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,690
you make this decision up we should

394
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,320
also

395
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,210
so try to do luke and to

396
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,630
consider as a factor in the decision

397
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,680
making process the tools that the software

398
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,960
provides in terms of privacy option so

399
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,480
if usually the decision making power

400
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:28,410
losses we consider simply the features or

401
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,450
the olympics

402
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,220
how powerful this tool is in terms

403
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,220
of analytics i think it's really important

404
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,280
to also add in the decision making

405
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,480
and these other options i haven't used

406
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,230
any other open source tools besides matomo

407
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,750
but when i looked into it as

408
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,700
the alternative

409
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,050
two google analytics it really makes things

410
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,670
easier and it does provide great documentation

411
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,950
in terms of how you should treat

412
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,660
the gdp are cases

413
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,210
the why you should consider my thermo

414
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,760
as a replacement of google analytics

415
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,940
the main reason here dimension is the

416
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,408
fact that what what when you are

417
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:28,590
using a google analytics who you are

418
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,490
sharing your data with google a big

419
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,600
tech company which we cannot say whose

420
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:39,000
reputation hasn't been that great in the

421
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,310
real reason that last couple of years

422
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,200
do we also know that google uses

423
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,960
these data that you share with them

424
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,830
of your visitors they use it to

425
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,300
have feed their data basis for user

426
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,050
profiling which has been considered a big

427
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,770
threat by many privacy advocates a threat

428
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,150
not only to people of people some

429
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,320
data but

430
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,860
also to democracy we can dare to

431
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,340
say

432
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,580
with the google analytics you also do

433
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,040
not have ownership of the data you

434
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,350
are sharing data with google it belongs

435
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,970
to them and you have to agree

436
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,060
with their own with their own terms

437
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,160
anytime with my thumb or you have

438
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,970
options

439
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,970
such as the option to halls the

440
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,910
data on your own being eaten at

441
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,580
your home server if you have like

442
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,900
the technical

443
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,920
and skills to do so

444
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,310
as we discussed third year with my

445
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,170
thelma you also have this option to

446
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,530
annoy to avoid this annoying tracking concept

447
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:56,670
screens for those businesses who might be

448
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,320
able to

449
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,350
to configure moto mo in this way

450
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,150
while with google you cannot do that

451
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,290
because you are sharing

452
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,830
because they are using every data that

453
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,500
you share for their own purposes as

454
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,190
well and also with my thermo as

455
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,268
in the case of every other open-source

456
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:20,550
software you have flexibility since the software

457
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,470
is open source you have the freedom

458
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,810
to customize the software according to your

459
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,650
own needs too

460
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,120
develop plugins

461
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,190
so that they can perform other actions

462
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,260
so if you're a developer and you

463
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,140
want to customize it based on your

464
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,740
organizational needs you can do so or

465
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,430
you can allocate appropriate resources to customize

466
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,830
with my domo and of course you

467
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,420
have the option

468
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,700
the hosted on your own premises or

469
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,199
you can go for the month on

470
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,380
the cloud offering which in any case

471
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,080
one does not use the data that

472
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,990
you host in their flowed for for

473
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,240
other purposes as in the case of

474
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,000
google analytics and of course you will

475
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,770
be you will have this option to

476
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,790
be more independent because in a scenario

477
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,770
for example even if you are using

478
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,760
the method macleod

479
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
loud and they change their pricing model

480
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,950
you can also always have the option

481
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,830
to self post or look for other

482
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,760
options available and while with the google

483
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,300
analytics it is as it is appropriate

484
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,780
dirty software this migration process might be

485
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,920
a little bit more accomplish

486
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,730
kate it then simply moving metal mall

487
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,860
your muthama data from one server to

488
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,750
another so this are some important considerations

489
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,390
to to take usually when people just

490
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,770
look for an analytics solution it's easier

491
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,040
to go for google analytics because it's

492
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,720
free in the sense that you do

493
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,840
not pay any money for it but

494
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,220
you do pay

495
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,350
and with the data that you are

496
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,100
sharing beat your visitors data and of

497
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,400
course and also by using a more

498
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,900
privacy compliant tool you can also gain

499
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,892
competitive advantage because in the cases of

500
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,280
data

501
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,330
shoes companies can also have like very

502
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,840
negatively impacting their reputation so if you

503
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,780
do take this appropriate measures about your

504
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,020
competitors don't then you'll automatically in a

505
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,160
way are gaining some competitive advantage over

506
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,490
them

507
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,710
so why do i tamo some of

508
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,864
the main benefits of using moto mod

509
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,430
as i mentioned is the fact that

510
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,700
you have one hundred percents data ownership

511
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,760
it provides so many privacy options which

512
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,580
you can customize and will help you

513
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,880
stay compliant with the virus legislation

514
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,750
and privacy laws depending on your scenario

515
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,000
where you are based or what kind

516
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,410
of data you are hosting

517
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,210
it's reliable and secure moto mois open

518
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,580
source and there is an active community

519
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,480
behind it for like actively contributing to

520
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,320
the source called reporting bugs and helping

521
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,990
in improving it and you have the

522
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,210
option to hosted on premise or on

523
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:36,810
cloud

524
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,279
regarding the privacy options of that moto

525
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,700
mod has to offer

526
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,160
it really makes compliance easier by providing

527
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,070
many features for the bedroom

528
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,330
and and to quickly go over this

529
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,990
feature matomo provides you with data anonymisation

530
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,950
and

531
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,490
because it is designed with privacy by

532
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,220
default in mind so it implements range

533
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,330
of data anonymisation techniques for example you

534
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,010
have the option to not record the

535
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,010
flight ip address of your visitors here

536
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,140
is a screenshot from the moto mo

537
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:28,380
interface where as you can see you

538
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:28,860
have

539
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,980
do the option to select how many

540
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,800
bytes of your visitor's ip addresses should

541
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,970
be masked and this gives you more

542
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,700
flexibility let's say in other way that

543
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,300
you are how you are hosting this

544
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,970
personal data of your visitors it has

545
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,410
a gdp our manager

546
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,990
two which of four for which we

547
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,150
will go in more detail later but

548
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,060
it helps you which will support you'll

549
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,970
have to respond in a easier way

550
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,090
to your data subject's request matomo can

551
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,910
be configured to not process any personal

552
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,370
data or b i i've shared in

553
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,600
the resources of this

554
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
slide a link which has a very

555
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,350
detailed guide on how you can achieve

556
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,860
this

557
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,790
there's the option to configure moto moto

558
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,670
automatically delete logs from the data that

559
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,570
database

560
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,760
which means that you can also automate

561
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,480
this process as well also according to

562
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,720
gdp are you should have this and

563
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:44,340
and this procedures in place also do

564
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,470
about the timing on how about data

565
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,050
retention which means how long do you

566
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,110
need to save your customers' data

567
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,040
so according to this procedures you can

568
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,480
also configure moto all in in the

569
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,470
right way

570
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,230
so that you comply with these regulations

571
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,990
are met almost supports the do not

572
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,440
track preference which is like do

573
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,000
about browser configuration of your users so

574
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,930
that they notify ultimate magically met the

575
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,110
omo also indicated that they do not

576
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,270
want their behavior to be tracked

577
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:35,145
moto mo has other options such as

578
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:37,905
to disable the life features to disable

579
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:41,745
tracking cookies you can customize the way

580
00:30:41,745 --> 00:30:45,075
how your users opt out of all

581
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:48,961
the trafficking you have you can delete

582
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:52,035
visitors data when requested through the gdp

583
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:54,135
prior to which we will look into

584
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:54,735
later

585
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:58,605
i also imagine that previously that the

586
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:00,795
date i stopped used for other person

587
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:04,455
purposes compared to google analytics you have

588
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:08,385
the option to disable visitor logs and

589
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:09,345
profiles

590
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:13,695
and options in terms of wherever you

591
00:31:13,695 --> 00:31:15,255
are starting these days though

592
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:21,285
so we also mentioned earlier all of

593
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:25,605
the rights that the data subject has

594
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:28,605
under the gpp are legislation

595
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:37,065
a sorta part of the background noises

596
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,927
i saw the gdp our manager hasn't

597
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,665
been developed to ensure that at websites

598
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:46,455
are fully compliant with this regulation and

599
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:48,705
it provides you with the right tools

600
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:53,565
so that you can take appropriate steps

601
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,125
to to comply here is a screenshot

602
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:01,936
from the gdp article from the motto

603
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:03,525
i'm an olympics and as you can

604
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:06,285
see it makes it quite clear and

605
00:32:06,345 --> 00:32:09,072
it keeps you informed of all of

606
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:11,595
the options that you have when dealing

607
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:16,485
with a subject's data so the first

608
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:17,805
do

609
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:20,745
djing in this menu would be to

610
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:22,545
search for the data subject

611
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:26,895
and this is what it looks or

612
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:30,135
what it looks likes in my thermo

613
00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:32,415
so you have the option to choose

614
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:35,415
and have the data source which can

615
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,785
be for from which website or if

616
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:40,335
you're hosting different websites who controls the

617
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,945
website from where you want to filter

618
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:43,602
this data

619
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:47,625
and here you can find data objects

620
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:53,715
by performing different filtering options to find

621
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:56,175
the matching data subjects

622
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:00,915
and in this way through this filtering

623
00:33:00,975 --> 00:33:03,945
tools there are various actions that you

624
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:04,815
do

625
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,895
can perform such as for example if

626
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:11,565
a data subject or subject was performed

627
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,965
they write off access to this data

628
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,425
after searching the data by using this

629
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:19,185
gdp article you can export the matching

630
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:21,075
results and send it to the data

631
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:25,155
objects and this can very easily

632
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:28,965
we'd be done by these export selected

633
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:34,665
visits button another option is to delete

634
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:37,845
the selected visits and you can apply

635
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,125
these in the case when the data

636
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,375
subject are on

637
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:48,285
applying their right of erasure and the

638
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:50,325
procedure that you have full always the

639
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:52,545
same you filter out the data but

640
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:55,455
in this case you will simply delete

641
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:59,715
those visits and inform the data subject

642
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:01,845
or for for this action

643
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,925
the data subjects also have the right

644
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:09,105
of rectification so in some cases you

645
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,295
might need to update the data that

646
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:13,905
you are storing in the moto mall

647
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:15,975
you'll have to do this by accessing

648
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:19,545
the database or modifying the records but

649
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:22,935
in some cases a workaround of this

650
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:23,235
law

651
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:26,324
when in setup word of that disposable

652
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,485
might also be to simply delete the

653
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,375
data if you don't need it anymore

654
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:34,094
and your data subject also have the

655
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:37,215
right of data birth ability and in

656
00:34:37,215 --> 00:34:39,945
this case you will again exercise a

657
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:43,605
similar similar steps as in the case

658
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:45,675
of the right to access and you

659
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:49,695
will send in a machine readable format

660
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:51,014
there

661
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:55,905
data through your data subject so that

662
00:34:56,745 --> 00:34:58,785
they they can access it and they

663
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,105
they can use it

664
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:04,875
for for their for example if they

665
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:09,015
are moving from your offering to another

666
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:12,045
service provider they have access to the

667
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:14,445
right to ask for of this data

668
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:32,085
and another right of your data subjects

669
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:34,035
is the right to object this is

670
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:38,145
applicable only when processing personal data with

671
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:41,025
a main interest as the lawful basis

672
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,275
and in this case you should offer

673
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,795
an opt out feature to your user

674
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:46,155
source

675
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:50,715
matomo again makes this easy through the

676
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,545
interface where you can customize the output

677
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,525
i frame as you wish and then

678
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,385
you can embed get scold on your

679
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:02,175
website to make it as easy as

680
00:36:02,175 --> 00:36:04,605
possible for your data subjects to opt

681
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:07,395
out when they wish and the

682
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,195
the also

683
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:13,695
visitors have the right to withdraw consent

684
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:21,015
and this is obtainable and only if

685
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:24,165
you are using constant as a legitimate

686
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:28,095
ground to to collect this data

687
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:34,575
i am migrating from google analytics to

688
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:38,625
matomo in my personal experience i have

689
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:43,575
faced this question a few times and

690
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:46,575
the procedure has been like quite simple

691
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:50,325
method that provides again very good documentation

692
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:54,765
that you could follow but again i've

693
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:59,955
tested this scenario with do not like

694
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:01,935
huge amount of data

695
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:07,275
but in each case you should go

696
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:11,775
over an evaluation process to make sure

697
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:14,385
that everything is working as it should

698
00:37:14,385 --> 00:37:17,835
for you so do for this process

699
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,815
as well and the resources of this

700
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,235
presentation i've shared a guy

701
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:29,175
guide from moto mo which hopefully will

702
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:32,685
make the migration easier for you in

703
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:35,355
case that you have already started google

704
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:38,655
analytics and you want to consider a

705
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:40,815
switch and start using method

706
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:46,935
so many thanks for hearing this was

707
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:47,835
i

708
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:50,325
the presentation for today so if you

709
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,635
have any question you can feel free

710
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,605
to arrive them in the chat or

711
00:37:58,905 --> 00:37:59,595
thank you so

712
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:02,985
ready to questions or discussions in the

713
00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:05,085
tub the first one is what do

714
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:07,305
you mean page to page titles and

715
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:09,795
pitch your own opera data do you

716
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:11,055
mean together with all that they do

717
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:17,295
but yes i do this because this

718
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,695
kind of data in the sort of

719
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:23,445
way can be used to identify and

720
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,035
can be converted into a b i

721
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,825
which means that if there is a

722
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,465
way that your data controller which is

723
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,535
the person who is tracking this data

724
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:41,985
and can match or it can reach

725
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:44,835
can i after your identity i

726
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:48,765
identity after collecting this information that means

727
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:52,215
that if you are hosting this kind

728
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:55,134
of like a search square is that

729
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:58,635
usual user month entering your website that

730
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:01,755
means that you are hosting personal data

731
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:04,455
and you should take appropriate steps to

732
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:04,815
save

733
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:08,355
quieted as jpr guides us

734
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:11,955
venture revenue

735
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:15,067
and even if anonymized a part of

736
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,805
the uterus isn't the whole of beatrice

737
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,305
stored in the database

738
00:39:22,515 --> 00:39:24,945
in the in the database it's stores

739
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:27,975
only the anonymized version of

740
00:39:29,295 --> 00:39:32,025
the ip address but of course

741
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:36,195
i know anonymizing ip addresses is not

742
00:39:36,195 --> 00:39:39,285
enough to say that you are not

743
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:43,035
storing personal data you should also make

744
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:49,365
sure about what other type of information

745
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:51,285
that you are posting but this is

746
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:53,235
like one of the features that my

747
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,445
thermo provides so that you can minimize

748
00:39:56,445 --> 00:39:59,355
that information so at least this is

749
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,325
like a step to more to more

750
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:03,135
privacy

751
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:08,505
okay and we have another question i

752
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:10,215
think it may relate to the prescription

753
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:11,355
because we have a bit of delay

754
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:13,605
but what about pixel tech

755
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:21,465
well that also falls under the

756
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:26,775
i have personal data because in some

757
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:30,165
cases they do a caucus might save

758
00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:33,315
some unique identifiers which can then be

759
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:37,485
used again to identify a person's identity

760
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,340
and thank you about that i am

761
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,350
going to wait for another minute to

762
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,910
see any more questions pop up

763
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,960
but that seems to have been the

764
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,800
case if any other questions arise feel

765
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,500
free to keep using the tablet it's

766
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,090
gonna stay up and besides that once

767
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,044
again thank you for the presentation and

768
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,960
depth and ready

769
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,940
they think everyone
