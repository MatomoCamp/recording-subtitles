1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
Well then, it's about two o'clock and with that, it's time for the next session.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,040
For this, I would like to introduce Sylvia Arapi.

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,360
She's a digital rights advocate with a special interest in the topics of privacy and intersect.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,960
And she is also one of the co-founders of Cloud68.co, working to make the use of open

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,560
source digital infrastructure easy and convenient.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,720
In her talk, How to Stay Compliant with Privacy Regulations with Matrimonial Analytics, she

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,280
will cover the importance of compliance with privacy regulations, especially from a business

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,240
perspective and how Matrimonial Analytics makes it easier for people to ensure the privacy

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
of their visitors.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,040
For this, she will go over a comparison with Google Analytics.

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,600
And with that, take it away.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,640
Many thanks for the introduction, Markus.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,440
Hello, everyone.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,600
I'm very excited to join this very first event of Matomo Camp.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,960
Today, as Markus mentioned, I will be speaking about compliance with privacy regulations

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:26,960
by using a digital analytics tool such as Matomo Analytics.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,720
A quick look into the agenda for today.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:41,920
I will quickly go over the discussion about personal data, why are so many regulations

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:52,400
in place in order to safeguard this data from companies, let's say, who are hosting personal

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
data.

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,280
We will go through the alternatives that we have when it comes to using digital analytics

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,560
tools, such as Google Analytics, Matomo Analytics, which will be the main focus of this event.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,120
But of course, there are also other tools out there which you can use.

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:23,920
And then we will go over the main requirements of GDPR and we will look into the tools that

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:36,760
Matomo provides us with, which support us to respond to the requests of data subjects

26
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:44,760
and as a consequence, that makes compliance easier.

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,240
So a few words about me, I am a free software and online privacy advocate, at least this

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,680
is what I do on a volunteer level.

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:04,600
I am a board member of Open Labs Hacker Space in Tirana, Albania, an NGO where I have contributed

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,520
for the last couple of years and where I had the opportunity to learn about the free software

31
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:21,200
movement and since then I've been engaged in various small open source projects software.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,880
I've mainly been engaged with advocacy and with a special focus on the topic of online

33
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
privacy.

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm also one of the co-founders of Cloud68, a company which supports other small teams

35
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,880
to make use of free and open source software.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,280
I've been using Matomo in the last two years maybe, despite the fact that I haven't used

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,480
it in a setup where we would handle like a huge amount of data.

38
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:10,560
I've closely looked into it as an alternative of Google Analytics, which of course not only

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:19,280
makes compliance easier but has many other advantages compared to this proprietary tool

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:31,800
which I will try to go into more detail later during this presentation.

41
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm sure that everyone who is hearing this session now couldn't have missed hearing the

42
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,560
expression that data is the new oil.

43
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:51,880
We hear this pretty often maybe in the last decade since 2013 with the Edward Snowden

44
00:04:51,880 --> 00:05:01,720
revelations about how personal data was being mishandled not only from companies but also

45
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,800
from government bodies.

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:12,680
There has been a lot of discussion and many other cases of data breaches have been published

47
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:22,080
which created and increased this need for a public debate about how companies were storing

48
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,040
personal data, how they were processing it, how much data they were holding and how much

49
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,480
information does the public have about this.

50
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:42,920
This increase of the cases of abuse we can say increased also the need from public bodies

51
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:52,440
to create proper legislations on the ways how these companies should handle the data

52
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,880
and how they should also take measures to protect it and to not abuse with it.

53
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:08,280
The reason why companies are so eager to collect as much data as possible is because of course

54
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:17,920
as this expression says it, data is the new oil, it means that there are also lots of

55
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,080
profits about collecting and making use of the data.

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:33,600
This is why it's really important to have proper legislations in place and to help to

57
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,520
hold these companies accountable about their actions.

58
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:50,040
Privacy compliance, a very short definition of the term is that it is a company's accordance

59
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,520
with established personal information protection guidelines, specifications or legislations.

60
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,680
Depending on your country where you are operating or where your customer base is at, you might

61
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:14,040
fall into different regulations, so this is a case by case, this can be treated on a case

62
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:24,680
by case scenario but two of the most not only popular but also more strict regulations in

63
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,920
place are the European General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, through which also during

64
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:38,360
this presentation we will look into more detail, but also the CCPA which is California's Consumer

65
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,240
Privacy Act, both are designed to protect and authorize access to what's called personally

66
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,480
identifiable information which we will also define in the upcoming slides.

67
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:05,680
So basically this presentation will mainly be designed for those companies who are gathering

68
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,800
personal data of individuals who are performing digital analytics but are also looking for

69
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:24,840
tools which will support them to stay compliant with these various regulations.

70
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:35,080
So despite the fact that there has been this long discussion and abuse about the misuse

71
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,560
of personal data, at the end companies also need to collect it because it's also a way

72
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,160
to serve their customers, to improve their experiences, to perform innovation.

73
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:56,360
So the main considerations here is that we should perform digital analytics actions in

74
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:04,700
this GDPR era by having ethics in mind and by complying and by using the right tools

75
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,960
which support our ethics.

76
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:19,840
So as I mentioned, while there are various regulations in place, one of the most strict

77
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:27,280
and most discussed ones is the European GDPR which requires all companies, despite the

78
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:37,920
fact that if they are based in the EU or not, if they are serving to EU-based citizens,

79
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
they will have to comply.

80
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,880
This is a regulation which strengthens and unifies data protection for all individuals

81
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,720
within the EU.

82
00:09:51,720 --> 00:10:04,000
This regulation of course is quite complex and if we were to go and dig way much deeper,

83
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:16,040
of course we would need the support of law consultants to discuss everything related

84
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:26,600
to it, but if we were to explain it very easily, it is applicable to a company every time that

85
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,960
it is collecting personal data, if you are storing personal data of these individuals

86
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,480
then you have to comply with the data protection principles which are guided by the GDPR.

87
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,840
So of course, in order to collect this data, you should also have a legal basis for doing

88
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
so.

89
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:55,720
You should always communicate this legal basis to your users which are called data subjects.

90
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,320
So they should be always informed about the type of data that you are collecting about

91
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,240
them and why do you need this data.

92
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:13,120
And of course, they have various rights upon this data which again we will look into more

93
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,320
details.

94
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:28,560
An important aspect of the GDPR is that it also included some other identifiers in the

95
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,200
concept of personal data.

96
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:41,840
For example, IP addresses, if an IP address can be used to uniquely identify a person,

97
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:50,400
this under the GDPR, this is also considered personal information and personal data.

98
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,880
So it's not enough to have like very concrete information about the person which falls under

99
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:06,120
the PII such as their name, their home address, their email address, but if there are some

100
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:17,000
sort of third party identifiers which you can use to match and in another way to identify

101
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,040
a person's identity, that falls under the personal data and here we include IP addresses,

102
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:32,280
cookie identifiers, page URLs or page titles, user IDs, e-commerce order IDs, locations

103
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,240
and hit maps and session recordings.

104
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,880
So this was a major upgrade with the GDPR to also include this kind of identifiers as

105
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,840
part of the legislation.

106
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,180
So every time that you are collecting this information, you should make sure that you

107
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:59,040
are following all of the GDPR guidelines.

108
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:07,560
So especially in the case of small companies who do not have all of the resources to go

109
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:21,440
over a very careful check of their internal procedures, they should try to minimise as

110
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:30,720
much as possible the amount of personal data that they are saving about their individuals

111
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:40,160
and when possible, if they do not really need it, they should completely avoid doing so.

112
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:48,080
And of course there are ways, for example, if in your website you are hosting a digital

113
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,040
analytics solution but you are mainly interested in analysing the user behaviour but you don't

114
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,880
really need to know who these users are, then you should make sure to configure your tools

115
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:07,440
in the right way so that you just get the information that you need but without hosting

116
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,680
any type of personal information about your visitors.

117
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:24,600
So in this way you will save yourself a lot of time and resources which you otherwise

118
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:32,800
would have to communicate what kind of data you are hosting through your privacy policy

119
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,600
and also to comply with the data subjects request.

120
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,720
So in every scenario when you can avoid at all hosting personal data, you should consider

121
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,140
doing so.

122
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:59,560
Also another benefit, let's say, of not hosting personal data when that is possible, which

123
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,800
you can achieve by using a tool like Matomo, as we will see later, is that you can configure

124
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,080
it in a way so that you can also avoid the constant screens which are those annoying

125
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,720
screens that we see every time that we open a new website who asks, who informs us about

126
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:27,640
cookies and the data that they are storing because this has proved to also impact the

127
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:38,680
customer experience so if you can, in a way, avoid this at all, that can also be beneficial

128
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,120
for your business purposes as well.

129
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,160
Matomo actually provides a way for you to achieve this.

130
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,840
So in the case that you do not track personal data and you also need to have enabled cookie

131
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:07,600
last tracking, you can bypass this requirement which is quite usual by legislation such as

132
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:16,640
GDPR and the privacy to display this banner asking for cookie or tracking content.

133
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:25,040
The reason why with Matomo this is possible is that visitors aren't tracked across various

134
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,720
websites as it happens in the case of the Google Analytics.

135
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:40,200
Visitors can be tracked within different days, so in a time frame, Matomo does not perform

136
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:47,960
profiling of visitors and of course the data can be used for your own purposes and not

137
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,880
for other purposes such as in the case of Google Analytics with whom if you share the

138
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:07,920
data they can also use it for their own offerings.

139
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:15,200
An important consideration under the GDPR are the rights of the data subjects who are

140
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,840
the people to whom you are hosting this personal data.

141
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:27,920
Under the GDPR they have various rights which they can exercise any time and in order to

142
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:35,680
stay compliant you will need to have the necessary tools to respond and to perform this request

143
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,080
by your data subjects.

144
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,680
Some of these rights are the right to be informed.

145
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:49,280
You have to always communicate the kind of personal data that you are collecting through

146
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:58,280
a privacy policy, at least this is the most usual way to communicate this to your users.

147
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,760
They have the right to access this data so they can ask for you all of this information

148
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,080
and you will have to share it with them.

149
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,240
They have the right to ask for erasure of the data.

150
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,800
They have the right to ask for modifications of the data if they pretend that the data

151
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,440
that you are hosting is not correct or needs to be updated.

152
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,240
They have the right for data portability, which means that in some cases they might

153
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:35,560
ask for this data and you will have to send it to them in a machine readable format which

154
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,840
they can easily use afterwards.

155
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,680
They also have the right to object.

156
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,160
This mainly happens in the case where you are not asking for consent but you are performing

157
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:56,440
the data collection under the legal basis of legitimate interest and in this case your

158
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:04,360
users might have the right to object for the data collection.

159
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,240
And of course in the case that you are asking for consent they have the right to withdraw

160
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:18,600
consent and usually it's advisable to offer an opt out option which is easily accessible

161
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,320
by your data subjects.

162
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:33,280
All of these specifications under the GDPR put a lot of pressure on companies of all

163
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,120
sizes because no matter the size of the company they have to make sure that they are respecting

164
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,640
this personal data so they need to take all the appropriate measures to stay compliant.

165
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:57,760
This requires additional resources, more education within organisations to also train their internal

166
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:07,480
staff and to design all the organisational procedures with data protection principles

167
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,160
in mind.

168
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:25,240
So with this being said, when it comes to making the decision about your digital analytics

169
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:33,800
tool you might have to go through a decision making process when choosing the right and

170
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,760
appropriate tools.

171
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,840
As I mentioned during this presentation we will mainly go over the comparison of Google

172
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,520
Analytics and Matomo Analytics and why I believe that Matomo is better for privacy compliance

173
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,160
but of course there are plenty of tools out there.

174
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:05,080
The only thing that I would suggest is that when you make this decision we should also

175
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:15,160
try to look and to consider as a factor in the decision making process the tools that

176
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:21,640
this software provides in terms of privacy option.

177
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:32,440
So if usually in this decision making process we consider simply the features or the analytics,

178
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,840
how powerful this tool is in terms of analytics, I think it's really important to also add

179
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,600
in the decision making these other options.

180
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,600
I haven't used any other open source tools besides Matomo but when I looked into it as

181
00:21:51,600 --> 00:22:04,440
an alternative to Google Analytics it really makes things easier and it does provide great

182
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:13,960
documentation in terms of how you should treat the GDPR cases.

183
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,920
So why you should consider Matomo as a replacement of Google Analytics?

184
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:28,080
The main reason here to mention is the fact that when you are using Google Analytics you

185
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:37,400
are sharing your data with Google, a big tech company which we can now say whose reputation

186
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,000
hasn't been that great in the last couple of years.

187
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:51,820
We also know that Google uses this data that you share with them of your visitors.

188
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:00,940
They use it to feed their databases for user profiling which has been considered a big

189
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:12,500
threat by many privacy advocates, a threat not only to people's data but also to democracy

190
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,880
we can dare to say.

191
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,720
With Google Analytics you also do not have ownership of the data, you are sharing the

192
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,200
data with Google, it belongs to them and you have to agree with their own terms any time.

193
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:36,480
With Matomo you have options such as the option to host the data on your own, being at your

194
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:45,560
home server if you have the technical skills to do so.

195
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:51,960
As we discussed earlier, with Matomo you also have this option to avoid this annoying tracking

196
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:01,520
concept screens for those businesses who might be able to configure Matomo in this way while

197
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:09,400
with Google you cannot do that because they are using every data that you share for their

198
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,680
own purposes as well.

199
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:19,920
And also with Matomo, as in the case of every other open source software, you have flexibility.

200
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,360
Since the software is open source you have the freedom to customize the software according

201
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:32,640
to your own needs, to develop plugins so that they can perform other actions, so if you

202
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,120
are a developer and you want to customize it based on your organizational needs you

203
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,000
can do so or you can allocate appropriate resources to customize Matomo.

204
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,640
And of course you have the option to host it on your own premises or you can go for

205
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:02,160
the Matomo cloud offering which in any case does not use the data that you host in their

206
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,920
cloud for other purposes as in the case of Google Analytics.

207
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,680
And of course you will have this option to be more independent because in a scenario

208
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:20,880
for example even if you are using the Matomo cloud and they change their pricing model

209
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:28,800
you can always have the option to self-host or look for other options available.

210
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:36,800
While with Google Analytics as it is a proprietary software this migration process might be a

211
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:44,800
little bit more complicated than simply moving your Matomo data from one server to another.

212
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:52,040
So these are some important considerations to take.

213
00:25:52,040 --> 00:26:00,960
Usually when people just look for an analytic solution it's easier to go for Google Analytics

214
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:10,880
because it's free in the sense that you do not pay any money for it but you do pay with

215
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:20,880
the data that you are sharing be it your visitors data and of course also by using a more privacy

216
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:30,160
compliant tool you can also gain a competitive advantage because in the cases of data misuse

217
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,240
companies can also have like very negative impact in their reputation.

218
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,640
So if you do take these appropriate measures but your competitors don't then you automatically

219
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:50,720
in a way are gaining some competitive advantage over them.

220
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
So why Matomo?

221
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,560
Some of the main benefits of using Matomo as I mentioned is the fact that you have 100%

222
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,320
data ownership it provides so many privacy options which you can customize and will help

223
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:12,800
you stay compliant with various legislations and privacy laws depending on your scenario

224
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,800
where you are based or what kind of data you are hosting.

225
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:24,240
It's reliable and secure Matomo is open source and there is an active community behind it

226
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:32,040
who are like actively contributing to the source code reporting bugs and helping in

227
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:40,480
improving it and you have the option to host it on premise or on cloud.

228
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Regarding the privacy options that Matomo has to offer it really makes compliance easier

229
00:27:49,040 --> 00:28:05,040
by providing many features and to quickly go over these features Matomo provides you

230
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:13,600
with data anonymization because it is designed with privacy by default in mind so it implements

231
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,880
a range of data anonymization techniques for example you have the option to not record

232
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,040
the full IP address of your visitors here is a screenshot from the Matomo interface

233
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:34,280
where as you can see you have the option to select how many bytes of your visitors IP

234
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:41,440
addresses should be masked and this gives you more flexibility let's say in the way

235
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,480
that you are how you are hosting this personal data of your visitors it has a GDPR manager

236
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,640
tool which for which we will go in more detail later but it helps you which will support

237
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,840
you to respond in an easier way to your data subjects request Matomo can be configured

238
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:11,040
to not process any personal data or PII I've shared in the resources of this slide a link

239
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:19,840
which has a very detailed guide on how you can achieve this there's the option to configure

240
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:29,800
Matomo to automatically delete logs from the database which means that you can also automate

241
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:41,800
this process as well also according to GDPR you should have these these procedures in

242
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:52,320
place also about the timing on how about data retention which means how long do you need

243
00:29:52,320 --> 00:30:03,320
to save your customers data so according to these procedures you can also configure Matomo

244
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:13,040
in the right way so that you comply with these regulations or Matomo supports that do not

245
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:24,480
track preference which is like a browser configuration of your users so that they notify automatically

246
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:33,920
Matomo so in the cases that they do not want their behavior to be tracked Matomo has other

247
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:41,240
options such as to disable the live features to disable tracking cookies you can customize

248
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:49,720
the way how your users opt out of all the trafficking you have you can delete visitors

249
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:57,480
data when requested through the GDPR tool which we will look into later I also mentioned

250
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,000
it previously that the data is not used for other person purposes compared to Google Analytics

251
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,400
you have the option to disable visitor logs and profiles and options in terms of where

252
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:25,040
you are storing this data so we also mentioned earlier all of the rights that the data subject

253
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:40,760
has under the GDPR legislation sorry for the background noises so the GDPR manager has

254
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,480
been developed to ensure that websites are fully compliant with this regulation and it

255
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:56,920
provides you with the right tools so that you can take appropriate steps to comply here

256
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:04,400
is a screenshot from the GDPR tool from the Matomo Analytics and as you can see it makes

257
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,440
it quite clear and it keeps you informed of all the options that you have when dealing

258
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:24,080
with a subject's data so the first thing in this menu would be to search for a data subject

259
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:34,840
and this is what it looks like in Matomo so you have the option to choose the data source

260
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,200
which can be from which website if you're hosting different websites you can choose

261
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,600
the website from where you want to filter this data out and here you can find data subjects

262
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:59,040
by performing different filtering options to find the matching data subjects and in

263
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:07,000
this way through these filtering tools there are various actions that you can perform such

264
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,080
as for example if a data subject will perform the right of access to this data after searching

265
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:23,640
the data by using this GDPR tool you can export the matching results and send it to data subjects

266
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:34,120
and this can very easily be done by this export selected visits button another option is to

267
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:43,600
delete the selected visits and you can apply this in the case when the data subjects are

268
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:51,480
applying their right of erasure and the procedure that you follow is the same you filter out

269
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:59,720
the data but in this case you will simply delete those visits and inform the data subject

270
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:08,880
for this action the data subjects also have the right of rectification so in some cases

271
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:15,040
you might need to update the data that you are storing in the Matomo you have to do this

272
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,560
by accessing the database or modifying the records but in some cases a workaround of

273
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,120
this like when in setup where that is possible might also be to simply delete the data if

274
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:37,120
you don't need it anymore your data subject also have the right of data portability and

275
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:44,120
in this case you will again exercise a similar similar steps as in the case of the right

276
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:55,440
to access and you will send in a machine readable format their data to your data subject so

277
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:07,400
that they can access it and they can use it for example if they are moving from your offering

278
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:28,800
to another service provider they have the access the right to ask for this data

279
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,060
and another right of your data subjects is the right to object this is applicable only

280
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:42,200
when processing personal data with legitimate interest as a lawful basis and in this case

281
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:50,520
you should offer an opt-out feature to your users Matomo again makes this easy through

282
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,720
the interface where you can customize the output iframe as you wish and then you can

283
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,960
embed this code on your website to make it as easy as possible for your data subjects

284
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:16,360
to opt out when they wish and the also visitors have the right to withdraw constant and this

285
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:32,600
is applicable only if you are using constant as a legitimate ground to collect this data

286
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:41,680
my greeting from Google Analytics to Matomo in my personal experience I have faced this

287
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,080
question a few times and the procedure has been like quite simple Matomo provides again

288
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:59,440
very good documentation that you could follow but again I've tested this scenario with not

289
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:11,280
like huge amount of data but in each case you should go over an evaluation process to

290
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,320
make sure that everything is working as it should for you so for this process as well

291
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:28,640
in the resources of this presentation I've shared a guide from Matomo which hopefully

292
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,280
will make the migration easier for you in case that you have already started Google

293
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:45,600
Analytics and you want to consider a switch and start using Matomo so many thanks for

294
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,680
hearing this was the presentation for today so if you have any question you can feel free

295
00:37:52,680 --> 00:38:02,680
to write them in the chat or thank you Silva and there are already two questions or discussions

296
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,640
in the chat the first one is what do you mean with page titles and page URL or personal

297
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:19,400
data do you mean together with other data yes this because this kind of data in a sort

298
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:30,760
of way can be used to identify can be converted into a PII which means that if there is a

299
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:40,120
way that your data controller which is the person who is tracking this data can match

300
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:49,880
or can reach can after your identity after collecting this information that means that

301
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:57,240
if you are hosting this kind of like search queries that usual user might enter in your

302
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:04,080
website that means that you are hosting personal data and you should take appropriate steps

303
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:14,560
to safeguard it as GDPR guides us thank you we have another one even if I anonymize a

304
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:24,160
part of the IP address isn't the whole IP address stored in the database in the database

305
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:34,560
it's stored only the anonymized version of the IP address but of course I know anonymizing

306
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:42,520
IP addresses is not enough to say that you are not storing personal data you should also

307
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:52,000
make sure about what other type of information that you are hosting but this is like one

308
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
of the features that Matomo provides so that you can minimize the information so at least

309
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:08,800
this is like a step to more to more privacy okay and we have another question I think

310
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,800
it may relate to the first question because we have a bit of delay but it's what about

311
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:29,560
pixel tag well that also falls under the personal data because in some cases the cookies might

312
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:37,280
save some unique identifiers which can then be used again to identify a person's identity

313
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:47,360
