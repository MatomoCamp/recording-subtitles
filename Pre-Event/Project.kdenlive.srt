sixty minutes so forty five minutes of

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,070
presentation plus fifteen minutes of

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,980
questions and an answer i'm going to

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,010
talk about the specific topic which is

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,260
a Matomo tagged manager and i'm

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,910
going to try to cover as many

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,680
things i can so that's why i

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,050
decided to name it from eight to

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,030
setup my name is a whole new

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,320
sheldon i'm a professional consultant and trainer

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,650
on net more analytics and as well

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,090
i got to weave a couple of

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,820
friends this crazy idea of creating an

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,860
event named metal camp which will be

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,100
added next the monsoon sell two days

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,320
exactly from now where the id is

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,180
twelve people from all over the world

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,920
to come on stage and make a

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,480
presentation about met to move

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,570
analytics so as i am doing to

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,050
dish about to the sub presentation so

27
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,690
i choose the specific topic because the

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,420
last summer we ran a salvage on

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,280
the matter will cancel my promote kemp

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,270
dot org silva asking about what kind

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,310
of topic would you like us to

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,640
cover

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,650
during the multiple camp event which would

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,530
be on november the fourth and november

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,470
the fifth and the one topic which

36
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,600
was highly asked was a madman tag

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,190
module so the idea was to dare

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,770
to talk about met more tag manager

39
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,960
and why are we talking about an

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,930
events prayer event to date rest of

41
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,710
you shall evan

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,140
we'll be in one nonce the idea

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,090
is that as it's the first time

44
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,950
that we organize such an event we

45
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,720
have a team who will it said

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,490
don't know each other was no let's

47
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,300
say i t infrastructure define we decided

48
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,890
to launch a prayer event in order

49
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,810
to test our i t infrastructure in

50
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,580
order to ensure that under the day

51
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,360
we are able

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,800
to scale the different conferences for the

53
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,520
volume of attendees so this what we

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,780
are doing to death or what he

55
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,210
would like to thank two guys while

please feel free to do so

99
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,740
i saw the topic of today is

100
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,680
metamodel tag manager so we're going to

101
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,950
first start with a definition metamodel tag

102
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,080
manager is what we call it target

103
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,860
management systems authority already like three big

104
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,270
word here tag management and system management

105
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,320
system you

106
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,470
probably already and you are probably familiar

107
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,780
with it so if you are taking

108
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,360
a content management system for example such

109
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,850
as group power such as wordpress such

110
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,030
as i dunno proprietary solutions such as

111
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,310
weeks of that kind of thing you

112
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,720
know whether you what it refers to

113
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,790
content management system is

114
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,730
software which is here in order to

115
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,390
manage some content such as posts suggest

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
pages such as media or any kind

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,510
of also that said content that you

118
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,360
can imagine in a tag management system

119
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,900
instead of managing contents like must be

120
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,400
media and text content

121
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,500
you have to manage what we call

122
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,100
tags and tags are nothing more than

123
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,100
in fact tracking codes and some of

124
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,650
you may not be familiar with tracking

125
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,020
codes but you may i guess i've

126
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,020
seen at least once when you access

127
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,800
to you matter more installation and then

128
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,782
and the first let's add the first

129
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:13,800
step that you need to know he

130
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,630
built up to send some data to

131
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,880
your manual is to copy and paste

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,100
a snippet of tracking code or we

133
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,380
can call even if the tag which

134
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,970
looks like this and this is exactly

135
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,250
what we are talking about here times

136
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,830
are nothing more than those nipples of

137
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,960
god that you insult on your

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,780
a website in order to push data

139
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,910
to matter what would you sweat about

140
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,570
so metamodel tag manager is nothing more

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,510
than a piece of software a place

142
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,750
where you're gonna manage instead of content

143
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,600
you manage tags you manage striking codes

144
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
in order to push yield that i

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,060
could

146
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,710
tion to the next level is what

147
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,140
it is about so of course for

148
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,740
most of the people that don't really

149
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,020
see the advantage of fit because they

150
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,840
are used to play with these single

151
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,300
tracking code which is pushing most of

152
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,700
the time enough information in order to

153
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,040
to start in fact your analysis because

154
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,280
it's b

155
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,200
rushing out of the page that you

156
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,846
are looking out is pushing out for

157
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:17,580
the enabling trekking two clicks which are

158
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,620
performing downloadable clicks donated by fighters and

159
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,770
out links but it meant then that

160
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,960
in some cases you may want to

161
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,230
collect more interaction than the switch for

162
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:31,440
exam

163
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,660
for tomorrow he might be interested in

164
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
in measuring the fact that people are

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,039
scrolling down the page because you would

166
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,780
like to know is they read your

167
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,820
content entirety or at least if they

168
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,010
view it entirely if you have some

169
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,050
videos on your website you may be

170
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,270
interesting and no english people are clicking

171
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,240
on the play button pause button if

172
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,600
shoves

173
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,060
the picture on on your website and

174
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,380
when you although your mouse of a

175
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,210
damsel cause it gets bigger lakes elsa

176
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,460
zoom which is happening that's typically the

177
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,350
kind of thing that you want to

178
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,370
perform with an additional let's add tracking

179
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,150
data collection and let's say scenario system

180
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,740
and it's exactly what you do live

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,140
a tight measurement system

182
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,440
right away within this presentation i will

183
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,690
have cause nemo which was a website

184
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,730
and really implemented tech management system in

185
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,770
order for you guys to syria how

186
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,620
you can push your that that prediction

187
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,840
to the to the next level

188
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,770
this is exactly what i what i

189
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:34,410
just mention i'm not going to go

190
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,140
back on it and why should you

191
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,510
use a tag management system or why

192
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,550
she views net html tag manager while

193
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,820
for better management so it's exactly like

194
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,490
a cms so in the cms you

195
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,200
create a lot of blog posts

196
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
post credit different pages you have different

197
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,110
hotels and you know when it's published

198
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,810
who has done what and when is

199
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,280
exactly the same thing with a tag

200
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,350
management system the idea is to have

201
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,421
a backhand on which you know what

202
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,160
the different tracking codes which have been

203
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,560
implemented on your website who has done

204
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,360
what what has been implemented

205
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,400
did and here we are talking about

206
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,550
project management that's more transparency within your

207
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,260
organization about knowing about what your colleagues

208
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,500
have implemented already abouts i'd say so

209
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,380
about better communication between your i t

210
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,800
teams and marketing and communication teams it's

211
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,520
of course easy

212
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,460
to to know the what happened in

213
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,260
the history of your website in terms

214
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,600
of in terms of data collection it

215
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,610
says well better in terms of sexual

216
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,980
eighteen the sense that you know at

217
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,110
least what is deployed and when it

218
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,840
is deployed and it can in some

219
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,850
cases decrease the loading time of your

220
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,110
website because

221
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,930
most of the time what what you

222
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,640
do when you implement for the first

223
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,310
time your basic tracking code on on

224
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,620
your website you'll just cutting and pasting

225
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,660
it everywhere and when you add some

226
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,370
other tracking code you may have the

227
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,150
same lets said the same configuration like

228
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,830
putting it everywhere was with the tiger

229
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,817
management system you can decide

230
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,910
when you would like those tags to

231
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,650
be triggered or not and of course

232
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,410
if you optimize this while you can

233
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,740
only measure what you need and not

234
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,780
the extra data that you'll probably never

235
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,230
look at

236
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,770
and those as well and this is

237
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,840
very important to get them awkward to

238
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,300
me too marketing and communication team that

239
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,360
said to none they keep teams and

240
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,630
it allowed them to more easily deploy

241
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,440
advance a measurement without relying on let's

242
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,440
say on some deployment time from

243
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,000
the eighty two

244
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,660
the whole tag management system or a

245
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,539
walking while you've seen it it's pretty

246
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,700
similar to what you are used to

247
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,440
because most of the time you copy

248
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,850
and paste the striking color you put

249
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,920
it on all the pages with the

250
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,260
deployment of a tag management system or

251
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,190
do you need to do is that

252
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,440
instead of copying and pasting this code

253
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,240
and all the pages what you do

254
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,520
just click over here as it's very

255
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,800
simple isn't a metal type measure and

256
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,960
in fact you take this snippet of

257
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,060
code that you put those wet on

258
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,980
all the pages in fact this code

259
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,190
is going to substitute this one okay

260
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,170
so you take this one you copy

261
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,940
and paste it on all the pages

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,635
on your website and what

263
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,300
then on this one is deployed everywhere

264
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,920
on on your website on all the

265
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,380
pages on your website then you can

266
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,080
in fact use the back end of

267
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,060
the tag management system which will be

268
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,520
displayed over here so if you cannot

269
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,030
seats right now in your manual installation

270
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,500
that's probably because

271
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,680
maybe he doesn't have been installed so

272
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,150
it's a plugin that you need to

273
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,790
download and activate it's a flipper again

274
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,900
you don't have to pay for it

275
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,560
all either it means that someone give

276
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,260
you an access to maximo that you

277
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,480
have extra rights in order to have

278
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,830
an access to its we met tomorrow

279
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,210
you have the super user you are

280
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,780
and mean

281
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,760
you have the right access to have

282
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,590
the read access and you'll get done

283
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,300
and use access and you get as

284
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,430
well as special rights for the tag

285
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,018
manager so in order to play with

286
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,690
it you will need to escape to

287
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,820
your admin also beggars i don't remember

288
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,710
which one you know they'll fold them

289
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,630
to give you an access to it

290
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,550
and to get an access to it's

291
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,390
what you just

292
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:28,800
need to click and then you would

293
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,280
see shield the the backend and healed

294
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,140
the backend in fact over here represent

295
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,360
all the the tags and then different

296
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,340
configuration i'm going to talk about later

297
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,670
on which will in fact of fighting

298
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,170
the failed thanks to the tracking code

299
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,970
that i was that way string you

300
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,550
just right so in fact here this

301
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,020
is what we can call a master

302
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,110
tracking code which gun control okay what's

303
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,500
going to execute everything which is located

304
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,810
over here within this this beckon

305
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,810
i

306
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,560
to make it simpler this is the

307
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,890
classical configuration that that's odd so far

308
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,946
so this is your your website without

309
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,170
tag management system so you have let's

310
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,020
say one tracking code one tag for

311
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,870
every solution that you want to do

312
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,670
that that you use in order to

313
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,280
collect some data so let's imagine that

314
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,680
here instead of analytics the jazz it's

315
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,240
your classic metal tracking code here is

316
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,610
another tracking code that juggling started because

317
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,320
i dunno you are playing with some

318
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,740
advertising networks okay without naming it like

319
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,310
the big

320
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,510
the big american one of let's say

321
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,610
conversion tracking code and then in addition

322
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,838
to that you have as well and

323
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,580
those are tracking code such as let's

324
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,650
say that'd be testing and a b

325
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,410
testing submission with a tag management system

326
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,970
was going to happen is that you'll

327
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,770
just going to have your contain over

328
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,300
hips which is the messed up tag

329
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,190
that was showing you some minutes ago

330
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,450
so the metal motel manager digests container

331
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,120
and then in fact all those scripts

332
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,550
are going to be added within this

333
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,130
one thanks to the eu-wide that we

334
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,620
can see over here so here i'm

335
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,240
going to go into detailing this one

336
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,160
but as you can see i can

337
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,290
add tags so it's not like

338
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,290
i only sent out around that tomorrow

339
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,290
technology's a genuine name in order to

340
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,830
be able let's say to collect together

341
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,980
all the different tracking codes that you

342
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,140
would like to send to was a

343
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,450
playoffs all was the solutions that you

344
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,181
are on your on yourself out so

345
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,577
all you can do

346
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:40,980
is probably one of the one that

347
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,510
you will play the most with which

348
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,400
is custom html which allows you to

349
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,500
cook and paste any script that you

350
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,650
want over here and i am on

351
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,450
small flat out this is exactly what

352
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,060
what we want to to perform here

353
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,400
is that to us within one single

354
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,590
system and a tag management system all

355
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,790
all different tracking

356
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,640
codes held out to organize better or

357
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:03,810
that connection modem

358
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,710
and this is what i just explained

359
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,030
so this is the messed up tracking

360
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,500
code that you need to implement on

361
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,810
your website in order to get started

362
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,210
of course according to a different cms

363
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,430
that you are using ours as already

364
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,260
some plugins which are yelled down in

365
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,180
order for you to ever make this

366
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,550
installation event event faster

367
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,780
i hold does the tag management system

368
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,910
walk while he talks we've made me

369
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,150
three components the first one is what

370
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,770
we call a target so the tag

371
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,130
represents the position for which you would

372
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,178
like to send the data to so

373
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,400
is what we have over here this

374
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,930
is the list of the different tracking

375
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,910
code that's that can

376
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,910
can pick up unless you choose a

377
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,500
tag so let's i want to send

378
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,170
the data to metromile then you're going

379
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,610
to configure it i'm going to go

380
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,190
into detail into this one electron and

381
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,831
then you need to explain when you

382
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,050
would like the given tag to be

383
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,930
triggered said to be executive i'm going

384
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,070
to take that exempt

385
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,380
follow the diet some minutes ago which

386
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,270
was about cap you would like to

387
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,820
measure the fact that people ask calling

388
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,770
down your website and you would like

389
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,890
to send this information to mathml so

390
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,480
what you will do is that you

391
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,340
pick up a tag which is met

392
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,690
to one that he takes tag you're

393
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,070
probably going to send what we call

394
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,230
an event which is an interaction

395
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,630
one so you send an interaction to

396
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,180
maximal and you would like this to

397
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,280
happen every time that someone is cutting

398
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,588
down and to do so what you

399
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:35,970
will do is that you will select

400
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,960
a second let's say nickname the components

401
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,450
that we have willing to take measurements

402
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,270
of vocabulary which is a trigger

403
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,410
and this is what we have over

404
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,240
here so here you get the list

405
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,520
of trigger so to send a condition

406
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,740
in order for the tracking code to

407
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,690
be executed and here you are going

408
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,670
to select toys r borrow e underscore

409
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,310
rich enough to say okay if someone

410
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,590
is cutting down the page i want

411
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,560
the tag to be filed and here

412
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,540
by default is going to be failed

413
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,460
every time that's the people are going

414
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,620
to scroll down more than fifty percent

415
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,820
of the page or you can of

416
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,260
course change that out and say okay

417
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,540
when the score up to ninety percent

418
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,133
of the page and this is what

419
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,620
it's going to walk so as a

420
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,830
recap it's you select the list

421
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,310
i do

422
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,010
the place where you would like to

423
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,680
send data to as a matter more

424
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,710
a zone advertising platform or a seventy

425
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,630
and he was a tradition that you

426
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,450
have on on your sarah denver hill

427
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,550
as a trigger you defined a condition

428
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,990
you know deaf on the stack to

429
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,530
deploy

430
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,790
johan in order to execute your tracking

431
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,760
code and the lesson that not least

432
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,900
exactly like in content management system when

433
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,360
you write the blog post is by

434
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,180
default written as a draft and then

435
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,280
if you want to put the clive

436
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,510
to send it for real on your

437
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,710
website you need to pub

438
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:03,540
leash and this is exactly what we

439
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,770
have over here you see we put

440
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,859
a small rocket's it's the publish button

441
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,329
and when you click on it it

442
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,730
means that's what you configure over here

443
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,130
there's going to be sent to the

444
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,869
solution that you want is a matter

445
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,970
mole or as though they just hazing

446
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,470
platform or any wives

447
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,980
i am not going to detail much

448
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,660
about oid yourself it's a possibility because

449
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,520
i can talk about the profumo they

450
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,050
get dark as would have been valuable

451
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,820
and so on and so forth that's

452
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,310
not going to make it complex so

453
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,600
far i'm just going to make a

454
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,160
brief demo you know the for you

455
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,830
to clearly identify what's the point then

456
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,470
what we are talking about so just

457
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,470
to conclude with lid so the theoretical

458
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,690
approach is that you select a tag

459
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,730
to link it to a trigger and

460
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,230
then you publish okay you send it

461
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,290
live for the sake of the conference

462
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,460
where i'm going to do is that's

463
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,680
i am going to take a real

464
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,690
use case they did is that's

465
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,910
i use a website in the useless

466
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,010
web dot com which is randomly picking

467
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,420
up a website just for you

468
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,170
to know that not undertaking any website

469
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,210
from a client's ninety six this and

470
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,220
i ended up with a differing website

471
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,510
i saw

472
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,360
i dunno this website at all i'm

473
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,000
just going to try to show you

474
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,490
the whole attack metro will be useful

475
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,130
here so as i don't know the

476
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,990
webmaster of the website where i'm going

477
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,840
to use a great extension which i've

478
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,080
been recommended to me by a guy

479
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,330
named thomas pearson from digital his eighties

480
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,450
that's you will probably cease during the

481
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,740
night and the campus is doing a

482
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,790
lot of conferences about animals this extension

483
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,920
is available for google chrome chromium and

484
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,260
everything which is a google from something

485
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,888
it's name user css and javascript and

486
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:54,750
it's very useful because it allows you

487
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,790
to insult some tracking code

488
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,310
on the websites that you don't own

489
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,170
it's pretty good for fun demoing so

490
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
that's that's what i'm going to do

491
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,610
here

492
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,270
i thought first things first that i'm

493
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,280
going to show you what on the

494
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,980
website will look like in metal if

495
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,160
i will have use the tag management

496
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,950
system so i'm going to take the

497
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,260
classic tracking code i'm going to go

498
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,700
over on the website i'm going to

499
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,790
use this given the given extent

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,270
so the extension would just require me

501
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,570
to remove the html comments so as

502
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,570
the script tag like this and now

503
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,190
we are good to go so i'm

504
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,690
going to call it originally maximo maximo

505
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,680
camp okay save and let's go okay

506
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:43,950
so

507
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,240
so now what's going to happen is

508
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,640
that if i look at the website

509
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,440
right now the tracking cubs going to

510
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,050
be implemented so normally if i go

511
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,988
over here on this page i should

512
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,780
see that they get my visits okay

513
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,870
great talks and so this is this

514
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,110
is myself so nothing in craig

515
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,405
bore here okay it's exactly what we

516
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,880
were used to see we were traditional

517
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,010
matter more tracking can as you can

518
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,750
see a face cord down the page

519
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,390
and i've kept my my maximo

520
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,130
in crazy we've come and the reason

521
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,170
is that this is the classic tracking

522
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,700
code so it's just measuring the page

523
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,800
you and just a click as well

524
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,400
on outings and we mentioned it's as

525
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,680
file extension downloads so here let's imagine

526
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,970
for example i would like to track

527
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,710
the number of people which while clicking

528
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,159
on this

529
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,750
given the nature you see him like

530
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,250
clicking like five times on it

531
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,880
nothing's going to happen why is that

532
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,250
why because the classic tracking code of

533
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,750
metal has not been

534
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,260
he's not hyper here if i click

535
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,600
for example hill and our sis as

536
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,940
you can see on the bottom left

537
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,170
of the page is going to go

538
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,090
on the same

539
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,430
i think it's going to go down

540
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,700
index i gonna double check if this

541
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,380
will be measured by metal

542
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,680
yes this one's going to be measured

543
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,240
that may matter more it's just it's

544
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:13,160
not telling me that his analysis fit

545
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,950
but i could somehow guess it get

546
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,930
in touch either made too so i'm

547
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,370
going to click on it's gonna see

548
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,820
if

549
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,130
if it's gonna walk

550
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,070
no it's not walking so here this

551
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,540
is just what i wanted to show

552
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,430
you is that the classic metro mode

553
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,860
tracking code won't measure up probably everything

554
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,020
that's in it so if you want

555
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,460
to know for example if people are

556
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,530
interacting with your images if you want

557
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,150
to know if people are clicking we're

558
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,010
here on the image if you want

559
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,370
to know

560
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,860
if they reach a specific part of

561
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,435
the content of your page you cannot

562
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,040
do it by default with the classic

563
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,110
tracking code of medical never been to

564
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,880
see what's going to happen if i

565
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,700
deploy a net html tag match of

566
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,100
tracking code so i'm going to go

567
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,860
over here and type manager i'm going

568
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,420
to pickup the

569
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,360
container as i previously mentioned it's what's

570
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,760
going to happen is that's i'm going

571
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,070
to use on small disk this extension

572
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,182
ships so it's arched which one do

573
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:20,000
i want to play with it's this

574
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,700
one okay i'm going to remove this

575
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,970
one

576
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,030
and now we're gonna see what's going

577
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,870
to happen so

578
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,850
perhaps an unsafe okay what would i

579
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,120
do

580
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,790
now i go back on the page

581
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,110
nothing's going to happen and nothing nothing's

582
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,880
going to be incredible right now because

583
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,710
as you can see from the backend

584
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,840
of my solution i have not yet

585
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,060
configure the different behavior that i want

586
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,490
to measure like the score tracking like

587
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,900
the peak and made two and so

588
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,280
on and so forth so

589
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,300
this is what we're going to do

590
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,950
right now so i'm going to create

591
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,339
a new tag these tags then it'd

592
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:58,042
be like

593
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:03,110
the credit makes cool events matter why

594
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,160
it takes so i just want to

595
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,051
have a name which is different than

596
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,280
those of time which is what would

597
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,980
be implemented which is just measurement of

598
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,400
paid you

599
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,560
she i'm going to say okay i

600
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,530
want to measure nevins not pedro because

601
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,970
it does the sense i mean someone

602
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,830
who is running down the pages still

603
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,270
on the same page sure i don't

604
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,160
need another pitcher to be to be

605
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,760
recorded

606
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,350
then i'm gonna have to insult here

607
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,010
different values to see is specific to

608
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,673
events because an event is defined by

609
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,410
category inaction and and the name i

610
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,170
mean that that's what madame louise expecting

611
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,540
twelve as an event so here i

612
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,910
can i can fill them with whatever

613
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,120
day

614
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,940
today was the last time you organize

615
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,880
your company you organize your identity system

616
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,800
in a certain way and you want

617
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,930
to have a naming convention which has

618
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,330
which makes sense so most of the

619
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,220
time it's category and from there events

620
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,380
will be something like cat we want

621
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,250
to measure interactions the action

622
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,760
is

623
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,090
let's send the discord

624
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,710
when people performed a core and name

625
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,810
i could put the same name as

626
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,060
this one but will be like redundant

627
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,340
and so i'm going to do here

628
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,780
is that i'm going to pick up

629
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,630
over here what we call invaluable instead

630
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,310
so valuable means it's not going to

631
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,350
be out coded value like like i

632
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,790
did here is going to be some

633
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,480
sandwiches day

634
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,030
dynamic based on what we called the

635
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,367
dumb of the page document object modernity

636
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:36,920
which is the information we are on

637
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,820
the page and so here they are

638
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,070
then the one that i'm interested in

639
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,650
is technically being fucked a page where

640
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,360
i but i would rather prefer to

641
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,400
know who felt people are scrolling down

642
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,640
the page

643
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,380
page so i'm going to pick up

644
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,070
over here and scroll and it's this

645
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,280
quarter vertical doesn't they show and to

646
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,690
which level two people score down and

647
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,130
now i'm going to add a trigger

648
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,710
sort of trigger is as i previously

649
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,740
mentioned is the condition for which the

650
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,960
data will be collected so i'm going

651
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,370
to pick up over here those are

652
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,550
rich and i wanted to be filed

653
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640
i would consider like yeah fifty belsen

654
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,880
please find a niche and and and

655
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,260
that's it so i click over i

656
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,540
can create new trigger so what i

657
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,250
did or healers that i said to

658
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,960
the system police met

659
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,110
tumblr tag manager send an event with

660
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,780
those values was a category direction as

661
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,030
an action score and as a name

662
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,296
have become the dynamic value to which

663
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:44,720
people scroll down and i want you

664
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,090
to fire every time that someone is

665
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,060
reaching more than fifty percents of

666
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,920
the score of the page and i

667
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,080
can i can create my tag and

668
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,146
i can decide to publish which means

669
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,690
like everything which is now within the

670
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,180
container i wanted to go live so

671
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,990
i go over here

672
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,780
i give up

673
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,320
the name of depression so like a

674
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,920
scroll

675
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,350
deployments deployment and i click over here

676
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,260
and now what's up what is happening

677
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,690
is that every scene which was within

678
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,420
my container so hailed the measurement of

679
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,040
the page you the measurement of core

680
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,520
event

681
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,910
should have been if my team always

682
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,890
going in the right direction shouldn't have

683
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,900
been deployed properly so if i go

684
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,450
now back on the website while nothing

685
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,020
impressive is happening because i have not

686
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,180
yet scored down my page or if

687
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,740
i go over here i would still

688
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,753
say that's ok i'm over here and

689
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,760
the page is chris

690
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,860
city of your time is correct but

691
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,690
i have not yet scored down so

692
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,490
there was no score event with chalmers

693
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,560
job and now he face quarter down

694
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,820
as you can see i'm not yet

695
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,920
at fifty percent so i'm like fifty

696
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,230
percent here if i go back and

697
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,840
let my refresh nothing should happen and

698
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,460
this is no more because i have

699
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,260
not yet reached the fifty plus sometime

700
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,240
in which the fifty best this is

701
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,610
a long page on it's probably ok

702
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:10,910
i'm

703
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,720
i'm not yet at fifty percent but

704
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,980
i'm just going to refresh in order

705
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:18,560
to show you that's still not deployed

706
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,690
and now if i go that i

707
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,240
do ok here i guess i reach

708
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:25,850
a kiss to sixty or seventy percent

709
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,310
so normally if i'm lucky enough i

710
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,440
should fish well ok i'm lucky enough

711
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,060
to see as you can fish

712
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,430
the evans has to be measured so

713
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,890
like okay i reached the more than

714
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,110
sixty percent of the page it's pushing

715
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,740
to the system interaction scored and fifty

716
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,530
reach represent exactly what i wanted and

717
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,130
on those data sent as i decided

718
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,110
to send them as an event that

719
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,280
would sharp overhead and b

720
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,550
behavior and then event and i wish

721
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,100
them over yourself cause it's going to

722
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,680
give me a lot of valuable information

723
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,810
that they didn't have so fossil so

724
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,270
far we've a let's say classic tracking

725
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,492
measurement or i could say that people

726
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:10,190
are going into page but i don't

727
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,510
know if they are reading the content

728
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,380
one artist

729
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,910
i dunno is that interacting with the

730
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,280
patent owner and thanks to escort tracking

731
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,780
i can or would you say that's

732
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,060
ok at least understood that they can

733
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,740
also go down the page

734
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,430
and let's take maybe another exam poor

735
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:27,080
i'm going to take this burden which

736
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,210
is the the get in touch i

737
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,669
saw here it's a this one is

738
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,370
more for eye contact interaction so this

739
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,410
is of course very interesting because probably

740
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,720
i mean this guy i don't know

741
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,460
who is behind the website but probably

742
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,650
he or she wants to get

743
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,020
his move to chase or anything slightest

744
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,010
so getting the measurement of people whedon

745
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,650
intend to contact him i think it's

746
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,540
important so i'm going to do is

747
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,910
that i'm going up over night my

748
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,070
mouse of our found the on the

749
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,040
on the elements because i will need

750
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,080
this adamant info

751
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,150
formation in order to configure and i

752
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,830
met him one time manager here what

753
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,080
they can see is that i have

754
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,140
it's a link which is in a

755
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,530
cif which contains an information which is

756
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,420
made to such so as

757
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,570
i text him and which is get

758
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,940
in touch so he like i can

759
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,040
play differently i can configure it differently

760
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,810
but i guess that in my case

761
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,760
i would probably be so okay everytime

762
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,370
someone's going to click on the link

763
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,970
on the page which contained information get

764
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,400
in touch as a text sediment i

765
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,600
want and information

766
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,820
to be sent to more so that

767
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,200
that's what i would do so i'm

768
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,520
going to go back over here with

769
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,680
maximal i'm gonna select matawan ethics as

770
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,140
a target group definitely decide to send

771
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,460
the data to a sub of the

772
00:29:52,464 --> 00:29:54,680
player i mean that that's the refinement

773
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,760
of course depends of the different permission

774
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,529
system that you are using but in

775
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,273
my case i'm just using that one

776
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:03,768
a tick so i'm going to cut

777
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:07,370
it like a intense them to contact

778
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,520
intend to contact

779
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,610
the kid when they met more antics

780
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,730
and so here i could decide to

781
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,200
send it as an event or to

782
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
send it as a as a goal

783
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,160
maybe for the sake of this example

784
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,770
i'm going to use a goal the

785
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,060
reason why i would like to use

786
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,040
a good just for this presentation for

787
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,630
you guys to see the difference so

788
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,880
let's imagine that i want to

789
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,865
it has a goal like the purpose

790
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:37,085
of my website is ready to get

791
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,515
some leads to get some contacts and

792
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:42,455
probably decent direction as family values and

793
00:30:42,455 --> 00:30:44,225
just cutting down if people are screwing

794
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,845
down nothing is standing in the dugout

795
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:48,215
contact and they'll chase my books receives

796
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:49,805
a contact me to get in touch

797
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,535
there's probably a highest probably tsh that

798
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:55,475
all those people convert so that's probably

799
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:56,765
why i wanted to find a good

800
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:58,025
heel result in an event

801
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:02,195
i'm going to add the trigger now

802
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:05,195
so the trigger will be an interaction

803
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,742
which is based on the click which

804
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:09,755
lays on the link elemental could it

805
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:13,025
like link click

806
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:15,125
me too

807
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:19,235
and here i'm going to use a

808
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:21,515
filter because if i just set it

809
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:23,435
like this it will be like every

810
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:26,405
link that they click on the website

811
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:28,325
which will be measured as a goal

812
00:31:28,325 --> 00:31:30,065
that's typically not what i want to

813
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:31,745
do because they have many links on

814
00:31:31,745 --> 00:31:32,945
the page as you can see i

815
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:34,895
got one here i got one here

816
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,095
i got i got many

817
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:38,675
so that that's not what i want

818
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:40,145
to do so i want to filter

819
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:41,885
it and i want to socal is

820
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:44,075
just every time that someone will click

821
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:46,925
on the element of the page to

822
00:31:46,925 --> 00:31:49,085
say healed the the link where the

823
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:52,325
value equal to get in touch ok

824
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,395
so click decks get in touch with

825
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:56,615
him saying okay if someone click on

826
00:31:56,645 --> 00:32:00,455
the link which contain the text which

827
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:02,495
is in my case getting in touch

828
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,975
okay and now i can i can

829
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:08,345
crate made by tag us it's nothing

830
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,605
to walks right to work or i

831
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:12,185
need to do first is to go

832
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:14,075
over a hill in maximal and i

833
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,385
need to add to the goal because

834
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,605
i haven't done it yet

835
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:23,101
and then to contact thought for the

836
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:24,455
people who don't know what the goal

837
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,155
is is that the most important action

838
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,565
that you would like to measure on

839
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:30,875
your website ie i'm going to select

840
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:33,815
men will gore because that's whole the

841
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,935
matter with technogym recognized goals which achieved

842
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:38,945
you need to send them as a

843
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:39,335
as an

844
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:39,635
one

845
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:43,085
i i'm gonna select the logo to

846
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,855
be converted more than one village just

847
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:46,955
for the book proposition as well because

848
00:32:47,495 --> 00:32:49,415
probably want us on during the visit

849
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:49,715
camp

850
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,945
the interesting contact me multiple times it's

851
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:55,655
not making much sense but wouldn't have

852
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:55,895
done it

853
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:58,475
i saw this what i just what

854
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:01,025
they do so same thing as last

855
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:04,685
time nothing extraordinary is going to happen

856
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:06,815
right now because i have not yet

857
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:08,255
i

858
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:12,155
i published my walk so now i

859
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:14,075
can decide to publish it

860
00:33:16,265 --> 00:33:17,645
but in my case i'm going to

861
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:19,685
use something that i have not yet

862
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:21,005
shown you which is the preview and

863
00:33:21,005 --> 00:33:23,675
debug because if i publish it means

864
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,505
finding enough to make some dimwit stuff

865
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,945
but if you do it for real

866
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:29,165
and that you mess up something up

867
00:33:29,585 --> 00:33:32,825
it means that's everybody's all the visitors

868
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:33,545
who are going to go on your

869
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,685
website when

870
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:38,723
i probably send you some fake data

871
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:40,086
on the wrong data on the six

872
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:41,765
i do so it's a good practice

873
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:44,105
to never publish straight to web just

874
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,645
to prove you first notice okay and

875
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,225
i want to see if my implementation

876
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:54,995
is correct rather than directly publishing it

877
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:55,325
live

878
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:57,725
in fact using the preview mode it's

879
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:01,925
like reviewing your content draft before publishing

880
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,935
it so that's what i'm going to

881
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:05,787
do here so in order to activate

882
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:07,505
pretty much you need to enable it

883
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:09,304
within the maximum talking about just so

884
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:10,775
as i did and then you need

885
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:13,145
to append the fourteen parameter at the

886
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:15,574
end of the us if false

887
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:18,125
the reason it doesn't work like like

888
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,105
right now it's probably that's you need

889
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,355
to clear your cache first so ctrl

890
00:34:22,355 --> 00:34:24,665
f five and then issue are lucky

891
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:27,425
so as i do you get inside

892
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:29,315
the preview mode which is activated here

893
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,594
so here had preview monday studying your

894
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:34,835
camp the first tag has been deployed

895
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:35,735
which is the

896
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,375
the page you want the fact that

897
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,415
the page has been viewed the score

898
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,355
tracking as not been yet filed and

899
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:44,676
that's normal because they are not just

900
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:46,889
scroll down up to fifty percent and

901
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,725
intend to contact the target has not

902
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:51,574
been deployed yet executed because they haven't

903
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:52,864
yet to kick them get in touch

904
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,655
just for the sake of the example

905
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,125
you see if i scrolled down the

906
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,775
page if i go up to fifty

907
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:01,415
percent i get discouraged over here and

908
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:04,625
discourage his executive okay so this is

909
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,185
what the preview mode is about it's

910
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:09,665
about showing you debugging and helping you

911
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:11,585
in knowing if the tag that you

912
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:13,565
implemented is walking on

913
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:15,995
i want going to do anything anything

914
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:17,405
with a creek and get in touch

915
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,325
and if i'm lucky enough no matter

916
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:20,825
what's going to happen the warheads that

917
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,535
never will be filed in order to

918
00:35:22,535 --> 00:35:26,045
say hey you know what's the trigger

919
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:28,265
that you implemented with the tag associated

920
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:30,935
to it walked and it has been

921
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:33,275
recorded bassist system so i'm going to

922
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:34,295
pick on getting to

923
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:36,845
ouch since that time kind of like

924
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,885
as you can see the link click

925
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:41,495
have been deployed and here i am

926
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:43,205
getting it so it's great it's nice

927
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,885
that the data has been sent

928
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:48,365
to to maximal so i can now

929
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:52,265
peacefully look over here and have in

930
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:54,095
fact as you can see the gold

931
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,945
which have been deployed so this is

932
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:58,685
in fact what matt moore talking about

933
00:35:58,685 --> 00:36:00,935
jelly's abouts as they say dislike pushing

934
00:36:00,935 --> 00:36:02,825
your data collection to the next level

935
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:05,825
by giving you the possibility to implement

936
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:11,345
very complex tracking let's say method is

937
00:36:11,345 --> 00:36:14,645
edi thanks to a beckham kept soft

938
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,895
cross shown like this you may have

939
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:19,025
the feeling that's okay it's like super

940
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:20,465
how to do it is like it's

941
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:22,205
going to take me i what else

942
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:23,945
to do i needed training and so

943
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:26,375
on and so forth while just

944
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:28,475
veteran just by watching this video watching

945
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,964
this training let's say this conference you

946
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,705
already learn a lot after all it's

947
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:34,745
a lot about practice so in order

948
00:36:34,745 --> 00:36:36,755
to practise what you can do is

949
00:36:36,755 --> 00:36:38,585
exactly the way did it is like

950
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:41,255
using this extension and use a javascript

951
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:44,435
and css implement it on a website

952
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,115
that you don't own and then

953
00:36:46,835 --> 00:36:49,052
send the data to a net to

954
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:51,185
more website the twelve will be just

955
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:53,197
for the sake of the demo just

956
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:54,875
on the sake of practice and this

957
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,075
is how you can learn a lot

958
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,475
then you have as well unmet to

959
00:36:58,475 --> 00:37:00,965
move the quality of the food guide

960
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,845
which is over here that you can

961
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:04,925
you just need to type the tag

962
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:06,095
manager and you will see in fact

963
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:06,545
a fool

964
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:10,055
guide over here from the from the

965
00:37:10,055 --> 00:37:12,305
net with cima and then at the

966
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:14,495
end of the of the guide you

967
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:16,625
even get a tag match of training

968
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:19,295
also until jackie that's me again that's

969
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,995
with full videos that you can watch

970
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:24,425
expanding you everything that i just show

971
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,495
you step by step in order for

972
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:26,855
you guys

973
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:29,735
i used to feel more confident with

974
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,725
the the tag management system so that

975
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:35,525
that's really what i wanted to show

976
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:38,645
you as a said the didn't tell

977
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:43,805
me yet let's do it sam

978
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:48,125
the it's the basic and intermediate level

979
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:50,015
of using a mat to move the

980
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:51,935
majority to talking about joins in war

981
00:37:52,175 --> 00:37:54,425
this is about understanding what it is

982
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:56,735
about and being able to play with

983
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,625
the use user interface in order to

984
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,055
get ready to make some data collection

985
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,665
then of course have to accept some

986
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:04,325
practice

987
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,245
the effect of stuff to be used

988
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:08,495
with it and the next spot which

989
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,815
is about how to go to the

990
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:12,605
next level is about knowing what we

991
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:17,465
call the jews of the so that's

992
00:38:17,615 --> 00:38:18,905
my that's my

993
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:24,770
i that's night presentation but the next

994
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:26,045
but not have to move to the

995
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:28,055
next level is ready to understand what

996
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,095
is it that talia and how you

997
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:31,655
cannot use it and why is it

998
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:32,165
useful

999
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:37,595
so here's the controversy around the tag

1000
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,145
management system a time management system as

1001
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:42,905
you can see is mostly other ties

1002
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:47,075
for communication and marketing department guys now

1003
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,335
though to tell them okay now you

1004
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:50,255
have a super tools which can make

1005
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:52,295
super complex things and you don't need

1006
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:53,495
to rely on

1007
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,145
the i t guys any more

1008
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:58,115
that's the way it is advertise but

1009
00:38:58,115 --> 00:38:59,675
you have to know that's the way

1010
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:01,775
you play it the way i show

1011
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:03,065
you how to play with the tag

1012
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:06,035
management system it is just one part

1013
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:07,235
of it that's the part which is

1014
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:10,925
the less techy that's fallen to advanced

1015
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:13,685
and complex project you will need to

1016
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,155
use what to call it that talia

1017
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:15,725
which

1018
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:18,965
dispatch rely on your i t deference

1019
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:21,935
and will explain myself little bits

1020
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:27,125
that little is that let's use another

1021
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,915
example here in order for what i'm

1022
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:31,655
expecting you to to make more sense

1023
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:34,745
let's imagine for example that you would

1024
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:37,355
like to collect other data for this

1025
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:40,175
given page the hotel the page ok

1026
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:41,945
you would like to push to maximal

1027
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:43,895
decided that this gives

1028
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:46,355
page this given piece of content has

1029
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:48,095
been written by john okay

1030
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,085
the problem here is that's the name

1031
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:53,825
john is not on the page you

1032
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,274
see i can i can look under

1033
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:56,845
the page oh by the way of

1034
00:39:56,893 --> 00:40:00,485
john okay bad example i'm going to

1035
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,435
say like it's written by jones okay

1036
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:06,455
to get to know though joe dublin

1037
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:08,345
i don't have any johnny on the

1038
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:09,335
page ok so

1039
00:40:09,425 --> 00:40:13,865
that's that's problematic because i cannot send

1040
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:15,395
this data to know more than me

1041
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,412
as a webmaster i know that johnny

1042
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:20,735
who was just given page so how

1043
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:23,195
can i do this i was just

1044
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:24,695
with the time my jailed away showed

1045
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:27,605
to you i cannot between let's add

1046
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,495
to the contribution of the

1047
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,345
eighty guys thanks to that idea i

1048
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:35,525
could make this data available because you

1049
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:38,435
know within your internal system your cms

1050
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,045
for example or annual database that this

1051
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:42,875
is john the world the content because

1052
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,615
on your cms you have the possibility

1053
00:40:44,615 --> 00:40:47,015
to insult the data that the auto

1054
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:48,695
focus on board is just that you

1055
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:49,655
decided to know

1056
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:51,625
up on the page but you need

1057
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,035
this information in order to send it

1058
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:53,425
to met

1059
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:57,145
so what you need to play with

1060
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:58,285
what you need to have here is

1061
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:00,235
what we call it that area which

1062
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:03,265
consists of a piece of additional code

1063
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:05,755
that you add on the page in

1064
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,035
order for met with a module to

1065
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:10,195
be able to grab this information and

1066
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:12,415
then push it out to the system

1067
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,605
as it consists of lines of

1068
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:17,305
cut that ad like this like this

1069
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:20,605
one therapy on on the page and

1070
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:23,335
of course here what we call devalue

1071
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:27,565
are written in programming language most of

1072
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,725
the time it's peach peach all was

1073
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:32,275
a language that you'll def seems he

1074
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:34,345
is familiar with in order to fetch

1075
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:34,765
the data

1076
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:37,375
bays require the data that you want

1077
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:39,325
and then make it available for you

1078
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,795
within what we call it that and

1079
00:41:40,795 --> 00:41:42,715
a jar that you can afterwards

1080
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:46,765
get within the system so for the

1081
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:48,715
sake of the example where i'm going

1082
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,455
to do that i would go back

1083
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:53,033
over here and i'm going to add

1084
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:56,575
physical use this is definitely a thing

1085
00:41:56,965 --> 00:41:58,405
so i just was going to do

1086
00:41:58,405 --> 00:42:01,645
here i'm gonna just name like nato

1087
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:05,065
then i'm going to give him the

1088
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,585
name which is as i said it's

1089
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:08,785
going to dejan so

1090
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,035
yips so

1091
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:15,565
journeys and i should be good to

1092
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:18,715
okay so this is what i have

1093
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:20,125
now i have that idea on the

1094
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:23,605
page with valuable which is a though

1095
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:25,765
which has a value which is johnny

1096
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,615
and what i can do now within

1097
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:30,417
the tag management system since was going

1098
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:33,025
to go back on it gibbs amendment

1099
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:36,505
system doesn't create this valuable and you're

1100
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:39,235
gonna see that we can grab this

1101
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:42,085
value and make it available for the

1102
00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:43,375
time angeles i'm going to go over

1103
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,925
here and i'm gonna select what we

1104
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:47,005
call the the

1105
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:48,448
thirty yo i'm going to give it

1106
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:51,775
the name which is explicit on which

1107
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,425
of course correspond to the thirty one

1108
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:55,735
that i created which is auto and

1109
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:58,225
now is going to make a bridge

1110
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:02,455
