and the and i explain in this

23
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,326
a very short presentation why we are

24
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:21,906
we decided to to

25
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:27,906
to to to him to implementer a

26
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,606
statistical national statistical platform

27
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:35,885
from a legal point of view are

28
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:37,875
we are in italy we have a

29
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:38,376
co

30
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:42,036
a little context to quiet articulated by

31
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:42,936
the complex sir

32
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,146
the h's call it is called code

33
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:49,536
of digital administration in article seven it

34
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,426
says that public administration or

35
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:55,716
shall publisher on their website data on

36
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:59,706
user to user just statistics in the

37
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:02,916
code of digital administration gives you rules

38
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,556
about digital issue for the public and

39
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:10,266
private entities and that and it's a

40
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:12,486
rule itself illegal

41
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,956
framework or that must be followed

42
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:19,776
induction

43
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,926
and it says the public administration should

44
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:26,826
allow users to express their satisfaction on

45
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,946
the service quality in term of usability

46
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:35,676
accessibility and timeliness so public administration should

47
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:37,716
also publish or as i said a

48
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:41,016
day on the website the resulting data

49
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:43,206
including a heretic sir

50
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:50,257
in in in articles fifty three i

51
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,476
don't want to bother you with the

52
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,756
many legislative aspect but the dust to

53
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,586
say you that this is something that

54
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:59,256
is required by the law

55
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:05,466
and we added this this a coder

56
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:09,246
and says that the internet site of

57
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:12,366
public administration should respect the principle of

58
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:16,596
accessibility usability as stated in a specific

59
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:23,196
governmental guidelines and so the public administrations

60
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,256
should create a website that respect this

61
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:26,706
the spray

62
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:31,956
principal and about usability find ability completeness

63
00:03:31,956 --> 00:03:35,766
of information clarity of language reliability easy

64
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:39,216
of consultation on maternity and interpretability well

65
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,586
all the staff work but as we

66
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,086
know must be

67
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:47,166
add one this this level of quality

68
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,566
can be reached at only by

69
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:54,426
even about by monitoring the the the

70
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,986
use of a website to

71
00:03:57,246 --> 00:04:00,126
of digital services or by the user

72
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:01,686
so

73
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:04,776
of course there are many many other

74
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:09,126
way of projecting a good web services

75
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:10,984
but now just to focus on the

76
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,096
suspect in a webpage or agency for

77
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:17,462
digital he did he brought these guidelines

78
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:20,556
sir while we define the modalities for

79
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:22,866
the creation and modification of internet

80
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,886
websites of public administrations these guidelines as

81
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:30,126
well are something that must be followed

82
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:34,416
is not something like her and i

83
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:37,086
can say nice to have a feature

84
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:40,056
but it's something that the public administration

85
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,046
should respect her

86
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:45,576
and in this guideline sir we say

87
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:50,076
that again him and his statistics should

88
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:54,369
appear on each website the data eg

89
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,286
a day this is very important to

90
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,286
in this case data

91
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:04,686
you just statistics data remains inside the

92
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:08,166
public administration with this solution we redefined

93
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:11,226
and what is this solution the technical

94
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:11,946
solution

95
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:18,366
we developed a national platform which is

96
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:21,876
called web analytics or italia and the

97
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:25,746
room is an open source solution for

98
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:29,316
collecting and analyzing analyzing and sharing traffic

99
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:32,796
and user behavior data dedicated to italian

100
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:33,186
public

101
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,776
administration websites so in order so to

102
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,446
allies and improve the user experience sir

103
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:42,846
we developed we did we decided to

104
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,166
to develop the sir

105
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,296
a national platform

106
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,506
and this is the very first time

107
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:52,648
eatery for for italy for the government

108
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:55,836
and that we we have as such

109
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:58,596
a such as such a tool such

110
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:03,126
as a platform and then already many

111
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,346
many administration have

112
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:10,566
are are adjoined to the the solutions

113
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:14,256
and many more are going to to

114
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,396
join they sir

115
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:20,326
the spot formed by next year and

116
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:20,616
the

117
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:23,976
ok

118
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:30,246
a going out of out of italy

119
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:35,466
a wii and connected to the sir

120
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,556
platform this solution do with the regulation

121
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:41,916
of the single digital gateway the regulation

122
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,906
twenty eighteen mina and seventy twenty four

123
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:50,796
as establishes a single digital gateway at

124
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:53,406
europe level there to provide access to

125
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:56,796
information to procedures sir and to assistance

126
00:06:56,796 --> 00:07:01,356
and problem solving services the website addresses

127
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,176
say your europe or africa you can

128
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:06,546
see it on on my side and

129
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:07,146
and

130
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,466
so what we have to do with

131
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:14,466
the web analytics italia based on the

132
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:17,646
matomo and the sir your bureau platform

133
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:25,176
well this single digital gateway has thousands

134
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:27,756
and thousands of links to national web

135
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:28,386
pages

136
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:32,436
which contains lots of information specific information

137
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:33,396
this sir

138
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:39,276
the statistics about these web pages at

139
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:42,606
national level must be sent to european

140
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:47,286
commission and and this is written clearly

141
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:50,136
stated that in the in the regulation

142
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:55,206
so national authorities shall ensure that statistics

143
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:55,506
are

144
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:57,789
are collected there in relation to users

145
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,786
vz tsa on the gateway and are

146
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:02,196
on the web page to which the

147
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:05,016
gateway links in a way that guarantees

148
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:08,076
anonymity of the users in order to

149
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:10,326
improve the functionality of the gatwick well

150
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:10,956
we

151
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:16,086
yeah we we implemented that we connected

152
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:19,056
this a national solution with the european

153
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:19,896
europe europa

154
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:24,456
single digital gateway and in this way

155
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:28,296
we avoided as many other member states

156
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,396
are doing now i'll be avoid to

157
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,586
ask it to the single administration to

158
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:36,726
send the file like an exile of

159
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,976
something stuff like that or to the

160
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,746
european commission about statistics

161
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:46,806
what kind of information we gather will

162
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,936
number of fees it very very basic

163
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:52,266
information but the useful number of visits

164
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,956
a number of unique visitors per webpage

165
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:58,326
countries from which the user are visiting

166
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:01,266
the webpage type of devices use

167
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,716
austin and the time spent on page

168
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:08,376
the very basic one spot to

169
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:12,996
we have set up an automated way

170
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:16,626
to send this information regularly to the

171
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:20,106
european commission and more or less this

172
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:20,946
is the way

173
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:25,805
the web analytics a connect with the

174
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:26,256
other

175
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:33,793
notes of the europa a framework and

176
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:35,436
then from

177
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,066
it throws for four and till now

178
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,856
the the statistics are related at all

179
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:44,556
web pages only

180
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,806
and from it and and and and

181
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:53,634
from twenty three twenty three these statistics

182
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:53,856
are

183
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:58,146
will be related to services online which

184
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:00,606
will be able to or written make

185
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,126
available by the end of twenty twenty

186
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:03,486
three

00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,031
borrow that cure him the lead developer

194
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,271
of web analytics italia the italian national

195
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:37,761
platform for webinar lee dixon the public

196
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,271
sector

197
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:42,561
w a i for answered why is

198
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,631
the short name we use for web

199
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:45,741
analytics he thought

200
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,331
while why am i talking about web

201
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:53,086
analytics italia it is the project and

202
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,181
now the platform that brought us in

203
00:10:56,181 --> 00:11:00,111
that knowledge of madama why is evolving

204
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:02,661
of courson and follow the evolution of

205
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,841
madama as well for example one of

206
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:06,801
the next steps

207
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,411
nowhere roadmap will be to upgrade to

208
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,241
version four of metal

209
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,431
three main points about why the first

210
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,401
as established by the italian lo the

211
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:22,371
collection of statistical data is mandatory for

212
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:26,331
public bodies the use of why however

213
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:29,571
is not mandatory but recommended because a

214
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:32,451
central collection point as many

215
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:34,461
the advantages as we'll discuss in a

216
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,031
moment

217
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:40,011
why turbine is connected to two other

218
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:43,701
national platforms one is in egypt pr

219
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:46,131
which is the directory of all the

220
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:49,341
public administration and the other one is

221
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:52,641
speed them the italian a digital identity

222
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:53,241
system

223
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,271
when we started designing webinar dixit alia

224
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:02,361
madama was the natural choice because as

225
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:04,731
you all already know it is completely

226
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:07,881
open source can be extended with custom

227
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:11,991
plugin and configured according to specific needs

228
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,451
in addition to these cons

229
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:19,161
immigration attorney law requires public administration to

230
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:22,941
use open source solution when available so

231
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:25,851
we had no other choice than metal

232
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:32,691
the possibility to collect data in one

233
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:36,711
central point was a strategic decision to

234
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,531
allow a national analysis and to address

235
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:43,161
certain processes such as the updating of

236
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:46,311
guidelines for the design of public websites

237
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:47,091
as cloud

238
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:50,841
you told before me now that the

239
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:54,111
platform is a quite stable even if

240
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:56,601
still in beta we are planning an

241
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:00,531
extensive analysis of the data collected took

242
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:04,521
struck valuable information about the interaction of

243
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:07,251
italian citizen with public administer

244
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:10,311
sure websites and of course the quality

245
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,171
of the websites

246
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:19,188
most of the administrations are using the

247
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:21,411
web analytics entirely and to monitor the

248
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:25,101
traffic for their websites are more municipalities

249
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,801
or schools the ease of use and

250
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:31,551
availability of an institutional solution allowed us

251
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,411
to bring these organizations

252
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,211
on board with minimal effort

253
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,451
there is a first step toward our

254
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,911
goal in the short term as if

255
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:43,461
we wanted to spread as much as

256
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:46,941
possible the diffusion of web analytics among

257
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,011
italian public administration

258
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:55,221
bouquet g dpr it can be a

259
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:58,011
concern we know especially for a small

260
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:01,907
organization the recent the c n a

261
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:05,601
a la recommendation has confirmed that our

262
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:07,791
choice to use matomo was the right

263
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,371
one the guidelines of the time

264
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:13,581
iam data protection authority also point out

265
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:16,071
that if we use matomo with the

266
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,791
proper configuration better minimize or personal data

267
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:23,964
we can collect the statistic without requiring

268
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,151
an explicit user consent

269
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:31,911
as you can see in the simple

270
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:36,951
diagram salt we are switching to explain

271
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:40,311
i'm going to discuss now how we

272
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:43,941
use matomo while the discussion that until

273
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:46,851
now was about why we use madam

274
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,101
well as you can see in the

275
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:52,071
in the symbol diagram our users interact

276
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,521
with why front-end them for logging in

277
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,791
and the websites and user management but

278
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,401
they eventually switched to matar more directly

279
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:03,531
when they need to view dashboards

280
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:08,061
wind trucks with madama by a poi

281
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,311
to perform the task requested by the

282
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,101
user in this interaction fence in the

283
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:17,301
backend the truck inside is completely managed

284
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,611
by matomo with a configuration that i

285
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:21,051
will discuss in a moment

286
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,411
this is them boarding process a forum

287
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:31,041
for italian public administration while after logging

288
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,941
in the user selects an administration and

289
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:39,171
the corresponding ural is retrieved from ethiopia

290
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,661
the directory of italian italiana been stretched

291
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:44,601
at this point why korea as it

292
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,211
creates a new website he met all

293
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,911
month and provides the tracking code to

294
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,341
the user so it can be included

295
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,191
in the source-code of the specific website

296
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:59,001
only after the vz starts to be

297
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,161
tracked then y will create a new

298
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,451
account the matomo

299
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:05,571
thus allowing access to the dashboard for

300
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:08,721
the user with this pattern we can

301
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,091
be fairly sure that the user has

302
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,392
permission to modify the code of destitution

303
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,731
the website at least the dineen disappear

304
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:19,011
for the selected administration

305
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:27,351
single digital gateway was described by cloudian

306
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,401
some minutes ago and is a regulation

307
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,461
of the european commission that states among

308
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,951
other things that each member state shall

309
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:40,251
collect statistics on vz to the pages

310
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,681
that are part of the euro europe

311
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,131
network your europe is a portal for

312
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,401
a european citizen looking for information rights

313
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,741
for your thoughts and procedures for their

314
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,041
personal and professional activities within the european

315
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:59,781
union the regulation requires the statistics for

316
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:00,501
each page

317
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,851
are transmitted using your account treat device

318
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,821
matrix thanks to moto alma we are

319
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,791
able to easily build a system based

320
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,851
on creating a segment for each you

321
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:17,091
are allowed device pair and then querying

322
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:19,491
the poi with a user calmed riddle

323
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,691
get countering meta

324
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,401
old for each segment

325
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:26,091
the resulting data is then structured in

326
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,791
the form of the required and automatically

327
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,341
sent to the servers of the european

328
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:31,941
commission

329
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:40,461
while our architecture of whether a dictator

330
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:40,881
alia

331
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:45,531
is stood within a cloud service provider

332
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,531
that is made available to the italian

333
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:53,116
public administration the white platformer is buzzard

334
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:56,241
that is based on that a room

335
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:59,481
on i asked subtypes are resistant sorry

336
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:02,211
within our structure we have installed that

337
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:05,241
kubernetes cluster that we use dorcas stray

338
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:07,611
to the different containers that make up

339
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:10,941
the whole system the only element outside

340
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,450
of the cupboard and a dishcloth series

341
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,631
is that the bms which is installed

342
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,431
on a dedicated to just one machine

343
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,901
for performance reasons

344
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:21,771
for the portal component which a lot

345
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:24,261
faster than the other components we have

346
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:28,641
activated a continuous integration continuous deployment system

347
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:30,741
that allow us to stay up to

348
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:32,811
date with the code in our github

349
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,411
repository

350
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,441
in the next slide i am going

351
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:38,481
to discuss in more detail the different

352
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:40,971
matomo containers you can see now in

353
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:41,781
this diagram

354
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,891
we have four different types of matomo

355
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:53,691
containers obviously we use keyword tracking plugin

356
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,751
saw her the first one is the

357
00:18:56,751 --> 00:19:02,181
ingestion container which only expose the moto

358
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:03,171
mod note

359
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:05,721
her p h b and pointer to

360
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:09,291
the outside world and collect data and

361
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,891
then queue them inside the readies component

362
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:17,541
the workers containers not exposed to the

363
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,661
outside world which the queue the data

364
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,331
from radisson and load them into

365
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,661
will the database then on the third

366
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,301
that kind of containers the web container

367
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:31,911
and the easy easy to expose the

368
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,881
to the outside that but only accessible

369
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:38,991
by authenticated users basically those coming from

370
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:41,991
the web portal and these for dashboards

371
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:43,491
and reporting in the in

372
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:44,121
general

373
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:47,481
the last one is the apia container

374
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,211
which at the moment the only allow

375
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,031
that visually just shown the visualization sorry

376
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:56,271
of regents butter with some limitation that

377
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:57,591
i will discuss in a moment

378
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:05,421
okay about providing reagents to authorize that

379
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:09,351
organization in order to provide our users

380
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:12,291
with a possibility of displaying widgets on

381
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,201
their website without at the same time

382
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,541
allowing the widgets to be included the

383
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:18,771
inane yet the web

384
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,796
we have adopted the two tire solution

385
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:25,366
on the web server using a specific

386
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:28,126
script we add in the response to

387
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,436
a request for a widget to a

388
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:33,646
content security policy header with the value

389
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:36,616
frame ancestors and the u r l

390
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:39,346
corresponding the madama to decide the d

391
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:42,196
in the request so the browser which

392
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,226
shall be frame only if embedded in

393
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:46,786
the specified euro

394
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,116
in moto mondays is the second tire

395
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,536
we then use a custom plugin that

396
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:57,496
rejects all request that do not contain

397
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:01,186
the module equal widgetized parameter in the

398
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:05,026
query string to avoid the rejecting valid

399
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,906
requests coming from inside the widget i

400
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:08,176
fray

401
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:11,176
graeme the plugin let them pass if

402
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,346
they contain the stringer module equal widgetized

403
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:19,276
inside the referrer h ttp either

404
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,606
some performance metrics

405
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,146
while at webmoney dixie tally we know

406
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:33,076
wherever a six hundred and seventy seven

407
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:37,276
tracking websites these websites belongs or two

408
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:41,086
oh five hundred and nine the public

409
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:45,046
administrations and considering that in italy we

410
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,816
have about twenty though

411
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:49,756
walls and the front administration were still

412
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:52,786
far from good coverage but the project

413
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:55,246
has already been quite successful and is

414
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:58,456
growing fast at the moment we are

415
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:02,866
getting about fifty million visits per month

416
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:06,286
for a total of about one hundred

417
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:06,976
and forty

418
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:11,116
million page views incoming traffic to the

419
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:15,826
ingestion component average is something like two

420
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:18,886
one rather transactions per second the with

421
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,676
peaks of up to three hundred and

422
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:24,496
fifty transactions per second

423
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,766
they are keeping job is currently our

424
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:31,576
least performing component because it takes almost

425
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:35,386
twelve hours to complete bear in mind

426
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:37,396
however that the ah

427
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:40,786
five hundred and ninety roll-ups one for

428
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:43,216
each administration must be added the two

429
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:46,696
there are six under the and the

430
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:49,546
seventy seven website so we have more

431
00:22:49,606 --> 00:22:53,236
than one thousand than three hundred websites

432
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:54,766
to process in there

433
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,046
in their giving job

434
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:01,456

457
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:12,796
situated in the region emilia romagna that

458
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,412
isn't as

459
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:19,576
smaller and smaller administration is monterey area

460
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:24,826
of administration and the region is situated

461
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,776
in the northern area all over italy

462
00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:31,216
and that is counting the

463
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,206
it's counting up sorry

464
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:40,306
it's contender for four million and an

465
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:44,896
asthma residence in an area not in

466
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:49,096
on an important area is about twenty

467
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:54,886
two kilometers of big and the and

468
00:24:55,156 --> 00:24:56,416
is at one of them

469
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,496
most devil aboard

470
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:02,446
or agency in italy and and the

471
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:04,216
and is a m

472
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:09,376
i can say am is a m

473
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:15,016
these are insane choices for other authors

474
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:20,656
and and as a kind of lighter

475
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:24,856
on an administration of other regions

476
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:30,604
aura is a very important to the

477
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:31,486
forum

478
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:37,876
economic growth and the industrial growth and

479
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:41,409
tourism so we have a lot of

480
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:44,206
products of it for a two tweeter

481
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:46,756
and you know a audiences are very

482
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:49,666
very careful about food the assault this

483
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,576
is a a big a big amount

484
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:55,516
of food but also he's a very

485
00:25:55,516 --> 00:26:01,216
good area of industrial growing about the

486
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:05,656
motorsports since ages different scene to the

487
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:10,366
tense of age or year so we

488
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,736
never played a lot of very

489
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:14,926
i have informed and very famous

490
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:22,756
examples of the very good the industry

491
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:22,996
all

492
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,886
and products the because of this that

493
00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:32,956
the region must be and must be

494
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:35,206
the administration of the region must be

495
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:45,616
i'm aware like the the private sector

496
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:46,366
and so

497
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,216
the administration master

498
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,232
accomplish they are their business it's a

499
00:26:54,352 --> 00:26:58,426
very hard the deity because the companies

500
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:04,786
are always asking for good results for

501
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:07,186
this sir because of this we have

502
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:10,576
we have starting started doing analysts

503
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:13,336
takes a lot of time ago it's

504
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,396
more than time ago then died ten

505
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:21,530
years ago and am merely in the

506
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,606
us anti sensor sensor twenty thirteen we

507
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:27,736
started using piwik

508
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:33,796
now called the matomo and the question

509
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:36,916
was providing the dead

510
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:41,536
the privacy for the users just the

511
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:46,426
just that the only the only them

512
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:49,036
different to a product that we can

513
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,236
use there was a

514
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:54,176
the google analytics but we were not

515
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:57,736
to happy with it because if you're

516
00:27:57,766 --> 00:28:00,826
following the previous of talk it was

517
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:05,882
explaining that the free free services from

518
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:10,786
our private companies are always an expansive

519
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:11,536
entire match

520
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:14,656
in term of the of privacy and

521
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:19,126
privacy cost so in a two and

522
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:21,976
twenty thirteen we immigrate to or system

523
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:26,506
from a barely logs analytica misery mentor

524
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:30,316
and to ariel a webinar politics software

525
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:31,696
and because

526
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:31,786
yeah

527
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:36,616
be weaker at that time was already

528
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:37,276
giving a

529
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,306
a better a better car and better

530
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:44,056
and i bet the amount of data

531
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:47,356
to misery misery and overall data because

532
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:50,826
it's because of its creeps because it

533
00:28:50,826 --> 00:28:54,646
was open source every customer label that

534
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:58,306
happened before the jd barrel rules

535
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:02,956
that coma comedy ninety nine twenty eighteen

536
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:07,936
and the song we were already already

537
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:11,146
sensitive about to this kinda of problem

538
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:12,076
of the privacy

539
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:17,656
and and aura database sides is now

540
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:23,754
about one hundred gigabytes gigabytes and the

541
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:26,716
most of the data is the report

542
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:29,956
table so we are collecting sensor since

543
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:32,536
the start ok we have a lot

544
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,286
of data

545
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:37,576
we collected sensor them to twenty and

546
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,266
thirteen

547
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:40,816
and

548
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:45,106
during the the last to two year

549
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,739
so we had them and all the

550
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:50,430
older the werther had the and a

551
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:54,016
amanda emergency problem with the with the

552
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:56,058
glow below with the globalise

553
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:57,886
i

554
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:01,006
the problem over there and i had

555
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:02,236
then

556
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:08,008
the solve the social problem with the

557
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:10,276
as individuals

558
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:17,686
and we started from am a situation

559
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:19,996
we can see here in the starting

560
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,476
point where all of the visits to

561
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:26,926
our website where about us leaping about

562
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:30,316
like sleeping but doesn't where they were

563
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:31,456
weren't really

564
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:36,346
this is what the aura bigger or

565
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:39,496
bigger amount of visiting least it's about

566
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:42,477
and then this event was called the

567
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:45,886
original election day as happened in that's

568
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,686
up in the in the in the

569
00:30:48,076 --> 00:30:51,316
middle of january over then twenty twenty

570
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,706
and then we had the problem with

571
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:58,366
the emerging problem with the way the

572
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:02,866
security national security and the the health

573
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:06,406
of the people at this time a

574
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:09,526
italy was the first to reverse the

575
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:11,566
country now are you in europe or

576
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:16,606
hit by the health problem and emilia

577
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,706
romagna was the one of the the

578
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:22,456
regents for one fiesta first hit and

579
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:25,066
the saw this was the amount of

580
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:27,826
data we collected by people that were

581
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,666
visiting our website looking for a soul

582
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,446
singer for

583
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:35,086
the source of the air or feature

584
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:40,275
information for for their life and this

585
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:43,036
a decent amount of data he was

586
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:47,626
also growing into in the months later

587
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:52,426
and then we expected the and i

588
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:55,428
and tablet the tablet the traffic on

589
00:31:55,428 --> 00:31:58,906
those websites during the two two twenty

590
00:31:58,906 --> 00:32:01,756
twenty and during this year and it

591
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:04,156
is not yet the end it and

592
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:05,686
so i think we are going to

593
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:08,596
get at the samer the same and

594
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:08,926
similar

595
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,666
level of visitors you see you can

596
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:13,846
see that the level it's really a

597
00:32:13,846 --> 00:32:16,516
tablet in the in in this two

598
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:20,146
years and that's because people was looking

599
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,776
for information about their their health and

600
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,926
also they discover that the aura website

601
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:29,086
is all the web

602
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:33,256
sites we have a ara ara field

603
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:36,166
the body a lotta a user for

604
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:39,826
information they weren't aware i forgot to

605
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:45,346
say sorry sorry for missing up with

606
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,116
the slides i'm very sorry

607
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:52,726
during that time i was watching the

608
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:56,089
analytics though and i was careful about

609
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:59,026
that this is more alive or alive

610
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:02,086
a record the visit the record and

611
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:05,026
it was like the memory i was

612
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,876
watching these numbers going on

613
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:14,266
and this is a now or installation

614
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,086
an installation that is based on the

615
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:19,906
two year twelve machine and who are

616
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,706
balancing the buy

617
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:25,456
around behind the eye they are on

618
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:30,196
under a load balancer and we run

619
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:33,376
and the cron jobs for making reports

620
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:35,896
every two years every two are worse

621
00:33:36,196 --> 00:33:38,266
every two hours we have a cron

622
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,966
job and this the worker load the

623
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,006
of the two of

624
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:44,956
the two in stasis

625
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:50,675
the blue liner is the memory amount

626
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:53,716
the user to buy him the moto

627
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:53,956
mo

628
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,646
and the the red line is the

629
00:33:57,646 --> 00:34:02,026
cpu load this is a smaller than

630
00:34:02,026 --> 00:34:06,161
the pasta because of the bhp seven

631
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:11,389
apple upgrade the disown a waiver is

632
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,656
a and never ages the average requests

633
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:15,166
per se

634
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,196
second and is this the situation is

635
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:21,406
not really optimized as your scene you

636
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:26,026
can run mme on on on containers

637
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:28,546
and i think is the best solution

638
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:31,426
to do it because you can be

639
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:34,906
and you can go with cheaper a

640
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,326
cheaper

641
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:40,038
configuration and spend the less than than

642
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:44,386
needed this is needed because we we

643
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:46,606
are in a situation where we are

644
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:50,296
not aware how much how much spikes

645
00:34:50,326 --> 00:34:53,446
we can we can afford but this

646
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:55,486
configuration was enough to

647
00:34:55,486 --> 00:35:00,706
all to enjoy this this a rollercoaster

648
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:01,726
mountains

649
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:07,306
so i let's go on on the

650
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:11,536
plugin development we we are one we

651
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:15,376
are contributing to maternal and for the

652
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:19,696
audience or us for more than five

653
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:22,576
years it's about an it's nearly ten

654
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:23,086
years long

655
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,636
longer we are doing good with the

656
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:28,906
metal alamo and the community so am

657
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,186
i you can see me

658
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:34,636
sometimes in the forum sir helping and

659
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:38,296
chatting with people and indeed during this

660
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:41,656
time women aged two public to to

661
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:45,076
plugins one of them is a plugin

662
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:49,576
who lets a missouri and let me

663
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:52,366
make the mutilation of people came

664
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,936
being from the internet the law in

665
00:35:55,966 --> 00:36:00,166
local local law locate an internal location

666
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,856
you're in town the location is pretty

667
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:07,846
configurable by the console the administration console

668
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:11,626
and you can you can choose a

669
00:36:13,036 --> 00:36:15,946
urine and you can choose a your

670
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:19,516

say your address user and the by

672
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:26,236
simple digits in regular expression

673
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:30,196
you can get at the sir david

674
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:33,886
this rapport this is important because

675
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:40,642
or internal colleagues wanted to do missouri

676
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:44,626
make amelioration of an internal internal audience

677
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:47,146
and the external audience on on the

680
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:55,209
than one one

681
00:36:55,246 --> 00:37:00,076
under the and fifteen website and we

682
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:04,306
have about the two hundred the user

00:37:04,366 --> 00:37:09,586
managing and the reading and reading their

684
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:10,726
analytics

685
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:15,496
and so la you can find this

686
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:17,772
plugin this plugin that you can find

687
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:21,376

688
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,942
motto more on the moto mo marketplace

689

but also you can find that this

690
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:31,216
your honor or use the oreos on

691
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:31,606
there

692
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:35,926
i catalog on the public administration catalog

693
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:39,556
he knitted this is important because you

694
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:42,406
say i am in them pasta in

695
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:44,416
the pasta and

696
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,386
as you see was really you'll have

697
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:50,082
seen in the past the talks of

698
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:53,266
by maya by claudio

699
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:58,426
and there's a lot of effort to

700
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:03,406
do making the local administration and publishing

701
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:08,506
their software when they they are asked

702
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:11,656
to publisher open source software online and

703
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,412
make it shit shareable with

704
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,546
with the way the public and so

705
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:19,808
this is part of our contribution and

706
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,786
this this part of contribution is also

707
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:27,916
now available to other public administrations also

708
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:30,016
and also and even then the shopper

709
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:33,633
them in the matomo marketplace the second

710
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:34,606
plugin the set

711
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:37,936
can plugin is not a dating plugin

712
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:41,386
because i had the very small amount

713
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:44,146
of of creativity in that day but

714
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:45,886
the the naam the name of this

715
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:48,526
plugin is that your reddit user user

716
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,806
data is not a dating plugin but

717
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:54,247
it the meaning to it mean and

718
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:54,733
that you

719
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:59,206
can the controller and the user

720
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:05,926
behavior inside that the madama and you

721
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:10,396
can omit them or you can avoid

722
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:15,196
them making a customer ranger rapporteur because

723
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,672
this kind of rapids outer bloating overloading

724
00:39:19,672 --> 00:39:20,446
good then

725
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:23,116
the application so we chose the two

726
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:27,781
that let them visit only a prerecorded

727
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:30,526
reports and the stay stick to their

728
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:33,556
to make this you must accomplish a

729
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:37,906
small modification of the user interface and

730
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:40,606
that and so and so this plugin

731
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:44,056
make your do it we have also

732
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:47,905
am am personal and team that you

733
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:50,296
you we use inside the but i

734
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:52,249
don't field i don't fell to what

735
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:55,846
was interesting because it's a very easy

736
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:59,716
to develop your plugin and during this

737
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:00,720
they did

738
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,746
these days and during this year so

739
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:04,156
i'd say the

740
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:08,566
we we also contributed to the to

741
00:40:08,566 --> 00:40:13,935
the development of madam and them's in

742
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:17,026
the darker boxer you can find the

743
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:20,716
as small amount of pop pull request

744
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:25,246
or pull request i've either ask it

745
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:25,486
in

746
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:29,086
the pasta and the also there are

747
00:40:29,716 --> 00:40:32,536
many many issues i raise in the

748
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,186
in the past i think

749
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,811
this kind of contribution is very important

750
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:41,567
to the community and it's very important

751
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:45,291
to the health of the matomo because

752
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:49,941
because it make you make them and

753
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:53,181
makes them the audience and makes the

754
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:55,671

to see if anything pops up because

793
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:42,951

814
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:00,621
