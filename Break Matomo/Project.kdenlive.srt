00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,920
the cape and with this i would

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,290
like to start the next thought it

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,012
is once again bottomless person or like

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,240
said before purchase recording see the business

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,009
developer at visually sweden and he has

6
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:19,950
rubbed with tracking digital analytics since two

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,160
posts

8
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:23,130
intent and has been a contributor to

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,260
open source since two thousand and seven

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,530
and in this talk outbreak matter mo

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,060
and author input how to fix it

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,850
thomas will share his experience with us

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,910
refund a federal large matter were instances

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,860
as most people know matomo can be

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,390
pretty slow when the tablet gross

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,180
and thomas will share some of the

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,980
biggest mistakes and also talk about how

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,130
they managed him and think it does

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,710
take away thank you for sharing sharing

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,380
paying a fairer you should a good

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,390
learning pan but i hope you guys

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,020
can

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,470
i asked a lot of questions founder

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,319
we will hopefully get some some interaction

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,990
going on as well so this is

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,380
actually based all my learnings through and

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,570
or our learned or should fight because

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,770
it's not only me up to to

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,330
tell is working with a number of

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,820
course but something we learned during the

31
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,080
last four

32
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,760
yes when we

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,930
progressed pretty intense on on the mouth

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
maintaining matomo for a lot of clients

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,040
so let's start off by doing the

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,330
short interrupt her

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,630
i'm a generalist but in this case

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,690
i've kind of had a background in

39
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,300
the nineties were actually worked with hosting

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,290
and they're maintaining the servers that were

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,480
really physical heavy and large at that

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,270
time so that knowledge i've kind of

43
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,730
brought with me doing it during the

44
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,600
years actually

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
the air got to use pretty intensively

46
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,260
while learning and managing matomo have for

47
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,430
our large clients

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,870
maybe you listened to my colleague concrete

49
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,590
yesterday that talked about how we technically

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,680
maintained very large installations of metal and

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,170
we're just to get an idea of

52
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,190
the size i think we have databases

53
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,830
that go above a beat than a

54
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,640
terabyte of

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,430
data that we collect

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,210
up to between fifty one and one

57
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,840
hundred million actions per month are stored

58
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,090
in these databases somewhere they're quite quite

59
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,190
big and we maintain them in a

60
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:44,370
setup using two burnett is where we

61
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,070
can scale things up and do obviously

62
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,380
not the most standard set up but

63
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,640
i will not talk so

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,980
much about cabinets today more about the

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,920
practical issues and their configurations that we

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
can can share with you guys

67
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,060
full

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,640
this is fair

69
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,610
the scenario that we're proud from any

70
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,010
of you have seen we get different

71
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,490
types of over error messages or reports

72
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,460
that are slowly matomo and obviously our

73
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,520
users can be pretty sad when that

74
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,120
happens

75
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,180
if you've been working with tomo you

76
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:25,410
probably and had these experiences over time

77
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,130
so that my pro tips if you

78
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,510
want to have this scenario

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,070
if i have three main principle guidelines

80
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,510
that you can follow if you want

81
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,030
to have this province the first pro

82
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,700
tips is to give your using matomo

83
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,130
a lot of permissions from stock without

84
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,760
training them

85
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,880
this i can guarantee you you will

86
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,250
run into a lot of nice issues

87
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,310
and province my second pro tips is

88
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,000
to write bad applications and stop tracking

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,770
them e matomo and then of course

90
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,540
blame at all for the problems that

91
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,130
you end up having

92
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,550
we're looking a bit more to this

93
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,060
a wrong and my number three pro

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,800
tips is to let your i t

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,140
department hosts matter more without the appropriate

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
training i will also discuss it a

97
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:18,930
bit in detail what this might lead

98
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,170
to

99
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,944
of course i'm a bit today and

100
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,160
joking mode here but i'll try to

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,077
give you some examples of why i

102
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,950
gave you these projects so the first

103
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,130
one about giving matomo uses too many

104
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,330
permissions at bottom is quite complex too

105
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,560
of course said

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,750
adding up tracking he said is something

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,780
that requires quite a lot of all

108
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,050
their skills in web development and also

109
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,090
you ask it and you also need

110
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,330
to know how the product works to

111
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,700
do this properly otherwise you will have

112
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,390
bad data in your database and the

113
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,720
repo

114
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,360
sweet be hard to to understand also

115
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,600
creating segments of custom reports has to

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,276
be pretty

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,040
you have to know what you are

118
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,030
doing so to speak

119
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,330
because they can actually kill your performance

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
i will give you examples of this

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,650
later on but also doing this wrong

122
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,960
might lead to really really bad user

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,230
experiences because you need to know what

124
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,300
you are doing and what you're showing

125
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,080
to your users so you should be

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
really careful about giving away permissions

127
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:38,880
and make sure that uses that can

128
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,070
create segments for instance know what they're

129
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,250
doing the last one or the second

130
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,762
one and write bad applications and blame

131
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,340
at all for the issues so this

132
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,070
is actually something you need to be

133
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,200
aware of that was always just a

134
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,340
stupid system

135
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,980
whatever you send to matomo will be

136
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,650
eaten by the system so you can't

137
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,710
really fix things that is broken in

138
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,230
your application or actually can and i

139
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,450
will give you some examples of that

140
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,090
but you need to have the mentality

141
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,750
of understanding that and not always just

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,560
a stupid system

143
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,870
so if you send bad data into

144
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,030
moto this could be personal data or

145
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,760
whatever but all will just eat that

146
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,110
and you will store it and you

147
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,350
will have problems in different ways at

148
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,950
the two most important things to manage

149
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:35,370
properly are ass and titus because these

150
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,720
two will always be

151
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
he just stored in matomo when we

152
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,220
send it send it

153
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,860
and your attitude is actually pretty important

154
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,760
to manage in a large installation in

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,360
particular

156
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,700
from the third guideline that laterite the

157
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,860
department health nut and without proper training

158
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,000
at will

159
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,900
this goes for many systems not just

160
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,710
matomo bus

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,720
why it face and i actually have

162
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,200
lots of experiences with it and we

163
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,820
help a lot of my former clients

164
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,690
they often approach us because they want

165
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,250
help with implementing tracking we're understanding application

166
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,140
but usually i spend about a week

167
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,170
without the department in the beginning just

168
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,960
to fix things that hasn't been properly

169
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,490
set up or taken care of

170
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,490
because maintaining moto moran application actually requires

171
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,940
you to know that the application is

172
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,500
not enough to just set up a

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,960
server and install the software and then

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,590
you're ready

175
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,820
not always really really have to let

176
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,860
you need to know to maintain properly

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,850
because it needs constant updates and the

178
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,100
testing comes with that when we have

179
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,560
a new release all the time when

180
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,120
you really need to test this and

181
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,630
know and understand what was actually stolen

182
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800
how will that affect

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,430
kt our instance of matomo even though

184
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,460
we do this twenty four seven we

185
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,740
work with moto my learn and we

186
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,420
still have problems when there are new

187
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,810
updates because you don't always know exactly

188
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,360
what will happen in your app

189
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,460
not my environment and this is of

190
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,770
course since it's a complex environment you

191
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,669
have plugins you have different integration and

192
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,400
so on and every setup is unique

193
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,149
we need to have constant monitoring in

194
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:44,100
place and monitoring in this case is

195
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,620
not only about dust but all will

196
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,520
respond it's it can be monitoring an

197
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,680
individual reports or a monitoring and database

198
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,650
for monitoring for errors really connected to

199
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,250
them at all

200
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,170
this is also something you need to

201
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,340
learn over time constant optimization or your

202
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,380
database will probably grow i will show

203
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,840
you examples of that and that means

204
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,530
he will continuously need to optimise and

205
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,390
again constantly change your configurations depending on

206
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,590
the needs of your

207
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,480
users so again feel free to to

208
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,650
do this internally and and but make

209
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,110
sure that the people that is taking

210
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,690
care of matomo has this as their

211
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,220
focus it's a huge difference to to

212
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,600
just

213
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,550
set up a server and install the

214
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,730
software and maintaining an application properly

215
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,010
so let's look into some of the

216
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,160
more specific problems that are related to

217
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,130
users i talked a little bit about

218
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,710
segments and custom reports because these both

219
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,940
to pass affects the aggregation him at

220
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,490
all and aggregation is the jobs that

221
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,780
happens under the hood and to produce

222
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,630
at the fast reports in the interface

223
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,690
if you go to the page use

224
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,990
the report that is actually an aggregation

225
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,820
of the raw data and to produce

226
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,270
that

227
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,950
there are jobs running under the hood

228
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,560
in matomo and they will require more

229
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,865
solar power so every time you create

230
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,180
a new segment for accustomed report you

231
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,790
actually add a new job or two

232
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,230
method before

233
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,040
seen recommendations in the community and and

234
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,080
we tried to have these recommendations as

235
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,600
well to not set up more than

236
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,433
one hundred segments for a site i'm

237
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,320
one hundred segments to be honest can

238
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,900
be quite a lot for your service

239
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,400
to to maintain as well so keep

240
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,000
that in mind

241
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,930
one thing we learned really really the

242
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,840
hard way is that if you create

243
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,740
segments see my total and you could

244
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,850
use these kind of wildcard questions in

245
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,180
your definitions they have a large impact

246
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,190
on your database performance

247
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,790
because what happens is you see the

248
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,920
sql query that is created this is

249
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,780
not the exact query but it's just

250
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,330
an example the important part is the

251
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,200
searched string at the end when you

252
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,140
send a query like that which happens

253
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,760
if you use it contains

254
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,020
setting is that we're not able to

255
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,560
use indexes imitable and and when you

256
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,260
create segments these queries goes to one

257
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,390
of the largest tables in the matomo

258
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,590
database and indexes these away too

259
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,060
medic credits faster basically in my script

260
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:00,750
but

261
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,810
these type of christ cannot use in

262
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,000
excess so that means that they have

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,370
to do a full table scan which

264
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,620
is kind of technical definition here

265
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,620
and that will really really kill your

266
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,390
performance if you have a lot of

267
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,670
data we're talking about

268
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,690
minutes to run sql queries if you

269
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,790
have a large database instead of maybe

270
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,528
seconds if you have a proper index

271
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,660
in place so the the impact can

272
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,480
be messy and especially if you have

273
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,250
a lot of these segments in place

274
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,480
on a large database

275
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,450
so instead you should try to change

276
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,690
your segments into using starts with for

277
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,200
instance if you do that your query

278
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,080
will be different and my skin will

279
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,810
actually be able to perform these queries

280
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,570
a lot faster though it's quite the

281
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:54,690
po

282
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,000
portland actually on a launched dataset to

283
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,140
to manage this

284
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,370
yes so with this in mind make

285
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,060
sure that only uses with with this

286
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,390
knowledge can create segments and that this

287
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,330
would also lead to that we avoid

288
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,340
bad configurations because i see a lot

289
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,160
of uses that use actually use segments

290
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,360
but in the wrong way i won't

291
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,760
go into too much about that but

292
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,610
alright again the example is if you

293
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,650
want to filter out the pages for

294
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,990
a specific section of your site i

295
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,630
often see users creating segments with this

296
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,100
because they misunderstand how segments work segments

297
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,370
is

298
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,100
is a way to to create the

299
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,520
bucket of users matching certain criteria if

300
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,482
so even though you will filter out

301
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:55,920
page views for that particular section you

302
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,960
will also fail to pay pictures for

303
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,150
other sessions that the use is matching

304
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,380
your segment criteria first have matched

305
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,130
so yup

306
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,770
different thing so

307
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:14,010
cape

308
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,110
yet one thing i often sees also

309
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,129
that i

310
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,980
uses

311
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,800
that creates segments that you can do

312
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,560
it on a personal level and suddenly

313
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,140
you see the segment as an administrator

314
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,120
and particularly on sites that a lot

315
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,160
of users i can see that sometimes

316
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,710
there are up to ten segments that

317
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,130
are almost the same thing because useless

318
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,370
crap

319
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,140
let's create some under the hood

320
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:50,070
under this is also bad because at

321
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,410
me tangibles are running under the hood

322
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,990
when you might only have needed one

323
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,320
of them

324
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,370
so yes let's keep that in mind

325
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,900
and of course this leads to avoiding

326
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,970
performance issues

327
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,900
also this is a nice one look

328
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,160
into that

329
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,940
global you need a peach pie fight

330
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,800
down your server and make sure it

331
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,150
has actually set

332
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,370
this is the user role needed to

333
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,040
add segments in that one so i

334
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,080
think that the default one is view

335
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,850
here and that means that basically any

336
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,280
user in your metal knees can create

337
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,890
segments so make sure to to

338
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:38,460
make it admin or super user or

339
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,460
write or whatever you or your organization

340
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,240
matches or so so that's the good

341
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,450
thing to look into alright so what

342
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,860
about bad applications

343
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,440
while that

344
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,530
one thing that is really important for

345
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,720
performance is to keep the number of

346
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,680
urine stone

347
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,880
and the thing here is that a

348
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,230
few for instance send a toma can't

349
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,170
differ between uppercase and lowercase so if

350
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,030
you have a page that will report

351
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,780
sometimes with an uppercase and some titans

352
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,205
with a lowercase metal movie handle that

353
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,890
has two different years

354
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,130
nz so make sure to to always

355
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,720
send lower case uranus

356
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,060
make sure to not send your parameters

357
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,370
if you can avoid that because that

358
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,600
will also create unique instances uranus meaning

359
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,460
and the job seem at all one

360
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,440
needs to process the tub for your

361
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,040
unique

362
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,280
also some cms says

363
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,900
sometimes sand trailing slashes the example is

364
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,180
my page and that will not be

365
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,010
the same as my page with an

366
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,970
ending flesh

367
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,140
another common thing that you might want

368
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,445
to avoid is for instance if you

369
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,260
have an issue number with unique you

370
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,380
or else containing numbers you might want

371
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,020
to look into anonymize these so that

372
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,930
you don't store unnecessarily

373
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,210
page views

374
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,500
so yup what i usually do is

375
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,406
that i create actually will show you

376
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,030
a script that without that can do

377
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,849
this later on but but this sometimes

378
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,830
you have an issue at your rattle

379
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,720
and you can end up with thousands

380
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,090
of unique page views so unique your

381
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,550
ants but no one will never look

382
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,450
at the uni

383
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,450
the page you for that so anonymize

384
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,140
them is actually good for performance and

385
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,700
probably also for

386
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,480
the analytics part to to understand the

387
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,900
site

388
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,710
so one way to do this this

389
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,890
is a custom javascript that i had

390
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,310
to recite that it's a it's a

391
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,320
variable so what you can do here

392
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,590
is that you created your cleanup and

393
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,960
in this example i started off like

394
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,150
i'm reading the euro from the browser

395
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,290
and making it lower case

396
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,560
case and the second one will remove

397
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
trailing slashes

398
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,090
then i'd have an example on how

399
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,970
you can anonymize an order id so

400
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,190
if you have and you're always saying

401
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,990
horner one two three four five six

402
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,170
this will become water flesh water page

403
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,170
and the way you use this then

404
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,300
if you go to your page view

405
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,180
and you use this variable in your

406
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,670
custom urine and by doing so you

407
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,780
can actually clean your site and and

408
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,250
this is also a good way if

409
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,430
you have problematic applications at this kind

410
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,770
of javascript can actually help you to

411
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,110
anonymize and remove personal data if you

412
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,930
have usually find those canvases so maybe

413
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,370
you haven't appliqued

414
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,750
nation that shares personal identification numbers or

415
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,420
email addresses from clients or whatever i've

416
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,750
seen tons of bad example there examples

417
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,510
there you can actually use this kind

418
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,250
of man your attitude to

419
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,530
to clean things

420
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,040
and another thing that i often see

421
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,610
on some cms systems aren't really terrible

422
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:23,970
here

423
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,010
so good and your unstructured look something

424
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,190
like this you have maybe are as

425
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:36,240
following your menu structure or other types

426
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,460
of categories and you can you have

427
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,520
a clear structuring your uranus and since

428
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
matan ways the stupid system it will

429
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,330
just take the euros asked

430
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,730
you send them to matomo a bad

431
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,450
example is if your cms will have

432
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,670
this kind of structure and this is

433
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,100
also bad if you're into su

434
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,610
of course but at that the point

435
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,590
here is like if you go to

436
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,890
your page views report you will see

437
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,600
something like this if you do a

438
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,860
nice your instruction you will have aggregated

439
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,900
numbers are matching your sections

440
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,170
but this is really really a nice

441
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:19,830
way to

442
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:23,805
or or a nice feature on having

443
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,975
nice applications

444
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:29,025
you can actually eat if you have

445
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,905
problems you can actually fix some problems

446
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:35,295
in this slum and so sometimes i've

447
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:37,815
seen applications where

448
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:41,685
where we have multiple neurons or for

449
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:44,235
the same page which is obviously bad

450
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:45,945
then you can add those

451
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,995
things in in into this year i'll

452
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:52,155
clean up your musket as well and

453
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,385
maybe air

454
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,749
make sure that they are reporting under

455
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,675
the same europe and you'll see a

456
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,505
broker or a muslim at least

457
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:02,265
but then there are a lot lots

458
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:03,675
of way we can help

459
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:08,595
help him alright so let's look into

460
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,935
optimized seem to move from a more

461
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:12,975
more of a server perspective

462
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:18,195
so some companies just seem to know

463
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:20,955
is that our transitions report is slow

464
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,455
if you use that one

465
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:26,415
the accustomed date trenches on slope because

466
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,305
what happens if you use a cap

467
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,585
custom date range is that you're actually

468
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:34,155
querying there the raw data the visitor

469
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:36,855
log obviously is something that can be

470
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:37,455
slow

471
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:41,475
sometimes you can see that today's data

472
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:43,785
is not coming in as quickly as

473
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,305
you good luck would it it would

474
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,145
like to maybe you don't see data

475
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:52,335
for today until in the evening or

476
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:55,605
whatever or uses get five hundred error

477
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:57,555
or timeout errors will type things like

478
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:58,815
that there is

479
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:01,215
no general solutions here but if you're

480
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,415
if you have a lot of this

481
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:04,935
and this is quite common if your

482
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,185
data grows you might want to look

483
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:09,585
into your server configurations

484
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,510
first of all look into the the

485
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:16,335
general guidelines always thought there to see

486
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,295
if your are you even following the

487
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:24,075
basics before you go into maybe my

488
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:26,775
more advanced recommendations later on

489
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:28,125
that

490
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,875
in general you need to understand that

491
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:33,915
matomo is a p h p application

492
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:35,655
and we usually refer to that as

493
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,095
a lamp installation

494
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:41,895
that means we have an apache web

495
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:44,235
server we have my a scam and

496
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,046
we have p h p c those

497
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,035
are the basic main components there are

498
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,465
more and you can actually change apache

499
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:55,605
to varnish or some other web server

500
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:57,615
and my scam can be maria db

501
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,365
so that don't take it to too

502
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:02,535
much of a

503
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,015
yeah hitler married but when you do

504
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:08,145
when you optimize these you need to

505
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:11,805
understand what kind of needs these systems

506
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:14,235
have so normally apache is a very

507
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:18,075
cpu intensive system meaning at what you

508
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:21,285
can optimize theories usually threads sometimes

509
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,015
something's a bit of a memory but

510
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,385
you can you can optimise hollow you

511
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:28,245
use the cpu

512
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,845
my style is usually memory and they

513
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,525
skimped and saved so make sure to

514
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:37,395
have the fastest this and then you

515
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:40,935
can often tweak my escrow at variables

516
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:43,485
and this is actually one thing when

517
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:46,665
i talk to either departments that has

518
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:49,455
been trying to maintain moto mo

519
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:53,115
do they usually install the database in

520
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,425
kind of the default setup that comes

521
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:58,485
with my sql and that is probably

522
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,305
the easiest way to make your matomo

523
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:02,835
server slow because

524
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:06,345
if you know my schedule you can

525
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:09,315
optimise i think over two hundred variables

526
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:11,085
that you shouldn't but you can

527
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:16,635
but on my scale application like nato

528
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:19,215
i'm whether it's very database intensive really

529
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:21,555
really needs a lot of optimizations

530
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:24,135
and there are great tools to help

531
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:26,535
you with that a peach pie is

532
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:29,565
of course super important and for that

533
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,235
we usually use the memory

534
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,855
and super important to cache the hp

535
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:40,125
because psp is a language that will

536
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:44,025
reprocess every page every time you see

537
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,515
it basically or everytime a function is

538
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:49,515
loaded it is actually processed unless you

539
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,035
use cache for caching is key and

540
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:53,295
when it comes to psp

541
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:59,325
one thing that is super nice and

542
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:02,685
particularly on larger installation is to use

543
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:06,345
the cute tracking plugin which would offload

544
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:11,445
your database significant sit significantly and also

545
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:13,687
give you features such as

546
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,855
you can restart your moto e installation

547
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:19,965
without losing data or really have to

548
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:21,915
look into this one if you haven't

549
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:22,455
already

550
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:28,215
you can also configure tons of things

551
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:29,025
in moto move

552
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,285
i linked to this little

553
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,685
file on tumblr dot org i can

554
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:40,095
assure you that actually

555
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:44,925
just open that

556
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:48,525
and just to give you an impression

557
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:52,155
but in your mental installation you have

558
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:55,335
a file called glow but the psv

559
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:57,735
this one is actually from github but

560
00:25:57,735 --> 00:25:59,145
just to give you an idea how

561
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:02,145
much you can actually configure on your

562
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:05,835
matomo server or your particular

563
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:09,525
amazon instance you can you can tweak

564
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:11,295
all of those things and this is

565
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:13,767
great because it means we can adopt

566
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:17,175
motto in tons of ways but it's

567
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,845
also it also means that you can

568
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:22,665
yeah you can get problems if you

569
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,305
don't know what you're doing so one

570
00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:26,415
thing you usually want

571
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:29,295
to have control of is the number

572
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:31,425
of rows that you're alone in different

573
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,115
reports

574
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,325
from a user perspective you normally want

575
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:37,935
to tweak this upwards there because i

576
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,555
think the default is that you show

577
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:42,135
only five hundred years and seen reports

578
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:44,085
and if you have a lot of

579
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,425
you rather see obviously want more than

580
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:49,605
five hundred but setting them too high

581
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:56,177
and that means the effective performance of

582
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:57,915
the scanning of forms if you use

583
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:00,315
the form analytics plugin is something you

584
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:02,085
should be really careful with that can

585
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:05,205
make your database grow also keep an

586
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:07,365
eye out over how long you store

587
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:09,525
your raw data this is normally something

588
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:10,815
you should know when you stop

589
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,945
but sometimes people don't have a clue

590
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:13,695
what that is

591
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:18,465
because that means growing the database is

592
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:21,915
growing a lot and also be a

593
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:25,305
bit careful with plugins because plugins we

594
00:27:25,785 --> 00:27:27,465
consume a lot of memories

595
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:31,305
and if you don't need them don't

596
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:31,875
installer

597
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:37,635
yes my sql that

598
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:40,605
but yeah this is certainly something we

599
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:43,005
learned we are using maria db and

600
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,135
what we learned is that there are

601
00:27:45,135 --> 00:27:48,645
actually features in my in matomo that

602
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:52,545
use functions in mind scale that are

603
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,215
not available in maria db so if

604
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,955
you're having a large database you might

605
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:58,065
run into problems

606
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:00,548
if you want to know the deacons

607
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:02,745
something her grandma call it linked to

608
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:03,738
those issues

609
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:08,985
ima ethanol tomorrow but one thing and

610
00:28:09,465 --> 00:28:10,785
on a launch date the base at

611
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:13,275
least you need to keep an eye

612
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,495
on the database size and you can

613
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:18,801
use tools like tuning primary over my

614
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:20,715
oscar junior for two to get the

615
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,905
incense and one thing we also learned

616
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:25,455
is that over time the number of

617
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:27,285
table c moto movie grow

618
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:28,785
and

619
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:33,525
you might want to check these configuration

620
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:37,875
options for actually configuration variables in my

621
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:38,265
scale

622
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,625
because if you don't adjust these according

623
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:45,105
to your database you might have performance

624
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:45,615
issues

625
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,285
there are also optimizations that you can

626
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:55,845
do to make transition reports faster so

627
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:57,225
there is an africa there

628
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:02,715
every muslim installation is quite unique so

629
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:05,255
i wouldn't recommend you to just apply

630
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:07,635
every index for the the message said

631
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:09,435
to find you should really try them

632
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,735
and test how they affect your installations

633
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:16,035
indexes can grow your database quite a

634
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:18,015
lot and you should do that this

635
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:18,495
with care

636
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,915
this is obviously something you can look

637
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:23,325
into and test

638
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,215
another thing that is quite common is

639
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,355
that you have an if you have

640
00:29:29,355 --> 00:29:31,755
a lot of segments and accustomed reports

641
00:29:31,815 --> 00:29:35,235
you might want to start looking into

642
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:37,875
how to optimize the archiving that happens

643
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,535
under the hood

644
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,535
one thing we've been doing is that

645
00:29:42,105 --> 00:29:43,725
if a client has a lot of

646
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:46,245
websites normally there is only one or

647
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,225
two websites that have a lot of

648
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:50,565
data and a lot of statements and

649
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:53,205
the other websites in the installation are

650
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,575
you should explore so one good thing

651
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,465
is actually to separate these into to

652
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:59,775
the different jobs meaning what

653
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:01,275
one job that might be happy and

654
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:02,865
take a lot of time will not

655
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:05,325
affect us more as sites so having

656
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:08,145
two jobs you can just do this

657
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:11,325
skip either site number one then force

658
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:13,365
i decide equals one on the on

659
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:16,965
the job then that when offload or

660
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:19,155
actually gave faster reports for the small

661
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:19,695
sites

662
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,365
another example is to

663
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,030
it's also that you run segments separately

664
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,100
that means that they're

665
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,630
if you're not apply any segment those

666
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,940
jobs might be faster but then you

667
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,190
might have other segments

668
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,390
that might take time if someone configured

669
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,900
for instance segments containing wildcards that takes

670
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,670
a lot of time you can actually

671
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,890
separate these into specific jobs maybe these

672
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,190
reports will take hours or two to

673
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,413
process but the other segments we respond

674
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,520
to

675
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,470
faster so that's something you can look

676
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,880
into and start tweaking

677
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,430
another example is that you want to

678
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,190
start optimizing your archiving process as you

679
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,700
can actually use these flags like concurrent

680
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,250
requests for a website or a concurrent

681
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,280
archiver cine can also stop liberating wit

682
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,240
and the

683
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,170
p h p memory that americans can

684
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,560
consume but this is really something you

685
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,070
should

686
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,090
i know what you're doing before before

687
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,540
trying

688
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,784
or you can try them and see

689
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:40,320
him learn

690
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,820
the one thing that i've been doing

691
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,610
is that i've actually created a plugin

692
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,330
to to warn you a bit this

693
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,160
is actually a plugin i wrote to

694
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,560
learn to how to write plugins sites

695
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,490
may maybe not the most beautiful code

696
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,470
i ever written but it's been a

697
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,960
good learning but what it actually does

698
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,290
is that it adds some reports to

699
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,860
my

700
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:11,490
my installation so under the hood i

701
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,130
can go in and get a few

702
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,940
recommendations so i have this performance tips

703
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,760
for instance that we gave me some

704
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,360
insights on how my database fees and

705
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,040
i'm doing some calculations on on home

706
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,180
my minds go

707
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,130
database is performing and in this case

708
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,350
for instance we're not really following their

709
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,430
recommendations

710
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,510
one how to configure motto this is

711
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,120
a database setting that we should changed

712
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,570
and also link to a recommendation former

713
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,390
tommaso yup this is something i've been

714
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,430
improving over time and we actually use

715
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,200
it in our database to to get

716
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,980
some feedback another thing i recently added

717
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,760
is regarding

718
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,020
the segments all

719
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,320
i was logged in i will fix

720
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,680
that

721
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,800
oh i can't actually because this one

722
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,480
requires me to be on a vpn

723
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,040
so we won't do that but i

724
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:15,600
actually created a list

725
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,640
of problematic segments so segment containing one

726
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,500
course you can you can

727
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,760
go to this repository and the and

728
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,470
download x and the

729
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,740
and please give feedback and may be

730
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,810
want to help to contributed to make

731
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,980
it to the photo there

732
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,098
the coding guidelines on what one but

733
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:41,670
basically i created some ways to easily

734
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,180
get

735
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,480
status variables and the

736
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,430
and things like that

737
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:56,580
yup what else we have to sign

738
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,450
for questions

739
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,150
and then thank you we have one

740
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,760
question the moon averages would you be

741
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,400
interested in publishing the db health plugin

742
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,969
on the marketplace definitely but i need

743
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,590
some help maybe it maybe lucas can

744
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,659
help me to to code reviewed

745
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,780
but i would definitely be interested in

746
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,230
doing that

747
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,103
if it's already free to download soon

748
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:29,100
so i guess

749
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,570
if newcastle bought it would be nice

750
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,620
the medal awaited

751
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,159
so if there any other questions of

752
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,409
if you asked him is it just

753
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,300
going to be the few moments for

754
